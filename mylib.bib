  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to use voxel-based analysis to simultaneously elucidate regional changes in gray/ white matter volume, mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with unipolar major depressive disorder. We studied 21 right-handed patients and 42 age- and gender-matched right-handed normal subjects. Local areas showing significant gray matter volume reduction in depressive patients compared with controls were observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, bilateral middle frontal gyri, bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, left parietal and occipital lobes, and right superior temporal gyrus. Local areas showing an increase of MD in depressive patients were observed in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, hippocampus, pons, cerebellum, left frontal and temporal lobes, and right frontal lobe. There was no significant difference between the two groups for FA and white matter volume in the entire brain. Although there was no local area where brain volume and MD were significantly correlated with disease severity, FA tended to correlate negatively with total days depressed in the right anterior cingulate and the left frontal white matter. These results suggest that the frontolimbic neural circuit might play an important role in the neuropathology of patients with major depressive disorder.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: Large-scale population studies measuring rates and dynamics of cognitive decline in multiple sclerosis (MS) are lacking. In the current cross-sectional study we evaluated the patterns of cognitive impairment in MS patients with disease duration of up to 30 years. Methods: 1,500 patients with MS were assessed by a computerized cognitive battery measuring verbal and non-verbal memory, executive function, visual spatial perception, verbal function, attention, information processing speed and motor skills. Cognitive impairment was defined as below one standard deviation (SD) and severe cognitive impairment as below 2SD for age and education matched healthy population norms. Results: Cognitive performance in our cohort was poorer than healthy population norms. The most frequently impaired domains were information processing speed and executive function. MS patients with secondary-progressive disease course performed poorly compared with clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting and primary progressive MS patients. By the fifth year from disease onset, 20.9\% of patients performed below the 1SD cutoff for impairment, p = 0.005, and 6.0\% performed below the 2SD cutoff for severe cognitive impairment, p = 0.002. By 10 years from onset 29.3\% and 9.0\% of patients performed below the 1SD and 2SD cutoffs, respectively, p = 0.0001. Regression modeling suggested that cognitive impairment may precede MS onset by 1.2 years. Conclusions: The rates of cognitive impairment in this large sample of MS patients were lower than previously reported and severe cognitive impairment was evident only in a relatively small group of patients. Cognitive impairment differed significantly from expected normal distribution only at five years from onset, suggesting the existence of a therapeutic window during which patients may benefit from interventions to maintain cognitive health.},

  abstract = {Objective: Cognitive deficits are frequently observed in major depression. Yet, when these deficits emerge and how they relate to the depressed state is unclear. The aim of this 2-part systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the pattern and extent of cognitive deficits during a first-episode of depression (FED) and their persistence following FED remission. Method: Published, peer-reviewed articles on cognitive function in FED patients through October 2015 were searched. Meta-analyses with random-effects modeling were conducted. Part 1 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of cognitive function in FED patients relative to healthy controls. Moderator analyses of clinical and demographical variables effects were conducted. Part 2 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of change in cognitive function at remission compared with acute FED performance in longitudinal studies. Results: Thirty-one studies including 994 FED patients were retained in Part 1. Relative to healthy controls, small to large impairments were observed across most cognitive domains. Remission was associated with a normalization of function in processing speed, learning and memory, autobiographical memory, shifting, and IQ. Lower FED age was associated with higher IQ, but more impairment in word-list delayed memory. Four studies including 92 FED patients were retained in Part 2. Following remission, FED patients showed small improvements in processing speed and shifting but persistent impairment in inhibition and verbal fluency. Conclusion: Significant cognitive deficits are already identifiable during a FED, with some functions showing persistent impairment upon remission. Clinicians must consider cognitive impairment alongside mood symptoms to ensure functional recovery from the FED.},

  abstract = {Background: Cognitive complaints are common in depression, and cognition may be an important treatment target as cognitive problems often remain during remission and may contribute to recurrence risk. Previous studies of cognitive performance in depression have mainly examined late-life depression, with a focus on older adults, or assessed performance in specific cognitive tasks rather than cognitive domains. Methods: This study examined cognitive performance across multiple cognitive domains in antidepressant-free depressed adults with early onset recurrent depression compared to neverdepressed controls. Domain scores were calculated for episodic memory, executive function, processing speed, and working memory, and the effect of depression diagnosis, depression severity, and depression duration on each domain score was examined, including interactions with age, sex, and education. Results: Currently depressed adults (n = 91) exhibited poorer performance in the processing speed domain compared with never-depressed adults (n = 105). Additionally, there was an interactive effect of depression duration and age on processing speed and executive function domain performance, such that performance was worse with older age and longer duration of depression. There were no effects of depression severity on performance across the cognitive domains. Conclusions: These findings support that processing speed deficits appear in young adults with early onset depression that may not be related to current mood. Additionally, the effects of cumulative depressive episodes may interact with aging such that cognitive performance deficits worsen with recurrence over the lifespan.},

  abstract = {A major problem in analysing the executive processes that seem to depend upon the prefrontal cortex stems from the absence of a well developed cognitive model of such processes. It is suggested that the central executive component of an earlier model of working memory might provide a suitable framework for such an analysis. The approach is illustrated using one proposed component of executive control, namely the capacity to combine two concurrent tasks. The application of the approach to patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, and patients with acquired brain damage is discussed. Finally, a study is described in which the dual task performance of patients with known frontal lesions is shown to be associated with observed behavioural problems. The paper concludes with the discussion of the prospects for extending the approach to include a range of other executive processes, and to the way in which such an analysis may subsequently lead to a more integrated model of the central executive, and a better understanding of its relationship to the prefrontal cortex.},

Alterations in the white matter connections of these regions may impair their role in mood regulation and increase the risk of developing depression. This study used diffusion tensor imaging to examine for white matter microstructural abnormalities of these regions and of central white matter structures in late-life depression. Methods: One hundred six elderly depressed subjects and eighty-four elderly nondepressed subjects underwent clinical assessment and diffusion tensor imaging. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in regions of interest placed in the white matter of the DLPFC, ACC, corpus callosum, and internal capsule. Differences between groups were assessed, controlling for age, sex, and total cerebral volume. Results: After controlling for covariates, depressed subjects had significantly lower FA values in white matter of the right ACC, bilateral superior frontal gyri, and left middle frontal gyrus. There were no significant differences in ADC values. Conclusions: Lower FA, representing lower tissue organization, is observed in depressed elders in the DLPFC and right ACC. These findings support the hypothesis that altered connectivity between brain regions contributes to the risk of depression.},

  abstract = {The present paper reviews the current literature on modern antidepressants’ effects on neurocognitive function. Today, it seems justified to state that SSRIs in general do not affect cognitive function. However, there exists some evidence that paroxetine is associated with a somewhat lower performance on neurocognitive tests than other sub-groups of SSRIs. Further, studies have consistently found sertraline to be better with regard to cognitive function compared to other SSRIs. There is a lack of studies assessing effects of RIMAs and  2-receptor antagonists on cognitive function. Some evidence suggests that the latter may have negative effects on cognitive function. Other studies suggest that reboxetine, bupropion and SNRIs may be more beneficial with regard to cognitive function than other antidepressants. However, the question whether these medications may actually improve cognitive function to a higher level than expected from improvement in depressive symptomatology, remains unclear. Clinical, social and emotional factors are important for cognitive function and these factors should always be taken into consideration when assessing effects of modern antidepressant therapy on cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Publication bias and questionable research practices in primary research can lead to badly overestimated effects in metaanalysis. Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses—that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications. We provide detailed results and simulation code at https://osf.io/rf3ys and interactive figures at http://www.shiny apps.org/apps/metaExplorer/.},

In March 5, 2019, nasal spray of (S)-ketamine for treatment-resistant depression was approved as a new antidepressant by the US Food Drug Administration. Clinical study of (R)-ketamine is underway. In a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, we compared the antidepressant effects of (R,S)ketamine, (R)-ketamine, and (S)-ketamine after a single intranasal administration. Furthermore, we also compared the side effects (i.e., locomotion, prepulse inhibition (PPI), abuse liability) of these three compounds in mice. The order of potency of antidepressant effects after a single intranasal administration was (R)ketamine {$>$} (R,S)-ketamine {$>$} (S)-ketamine. In contrast, the order of locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits after a single intranasal administration was (S)-ketamine {$>$} (R,S)-ketamine {$>$} (R)-ketamine. In the conditioned place preference (CPP) test, both (S)-ketamine and (R,S)-ketamine increased CPP scores in mice after repeated intranasal administration, in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, (R)-ketamine did not increase CPP scores in mice. These findings suggest that intranasal administration of (R)-ketamine would be a safer antidepressant than (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine.},

Information on deaths arising from such use in England is presented. Methods: Cases were extracted on 31 January 2020 from the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths database, based on text searches of the cause of death, coroner’s verdict and positive toxicology results for the terms ‘ketamine’ or ‘norketamine’. Findings: During 1997–2005, there were {$<$}5 deaths p.a. in which ketamine was implicated. Numbers increased until 2009 (21), plateauing until 2016; thereafter, deaths have risen to about 30\,p.a. Decedents’ characteristics (N\,=\,283): male 84.1\%, mean age 31.2 (SD 10.0)\,years, employed 56.5\%, drug use history 79.6\% and living with others 60.3\%. Ketamine was detected with other substances in most cases. Main (74.6\%) underlying cause of death was accidental poisoning. Ketamine may have impaired judgement in other cases. Conclusions: Although controlled, recreational ketamine use and related fatalities continue to increase. Consumers need to be more aware of the potentially fatal risks they face.},

  abstract = {Background: Ketamine and its enantiomers have recently been highlighted as one of the most effective therapeutic options in refractory depression. However, racemic ketamine and esketamine have not been directly compared. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of esketamine compared to ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, bicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, with two parallel groups. Participants were randomly assigned to a 40-min single intravenous infusion of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg or esketamine 0.25 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the difference in remission rates for depression 24 h following intervention using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with a non-inferiority margin of 20\%. Results: 63 subjects were included and randomly assigned (29 to receive ketamine and 34 to receive esketamine). At 24 h, 24.1\% of participants in the ketamine group and 29.4\% of participants in the esketamine group showed remission, with a difference of 5.3\% (95\% CILB -13.6\%), confirming non-inferiority. MADRS scores improved from 33 (SD 9.3) to 16.2 (SD 10.7) in the ketamine group and from 33 (SD 5.3) to 17.5 (SD 12.2) in the esketamine one, with a difference of -5.27\% (95\% CILB, -13.6). Both groups presented similar mild side effects. Conclusions: Esketamine was non-inferior to ketamine for TRD 24 h following infusion. Both treatments were effective, safe, and well tolerated.},

  abstract = {Objective The current meta-analysis examines the effects of ketamine infusion on depressive symptoms over time in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Methods Following a systematic review of the literature, data were extracted from 21 studies (n = 437 receiving ketamine) and analysed at four post-infusion time points (4 h, 24 h, 7 days and 12–14 days). The moderating effects of several factors were assessed including: repeat/single infusion, diagnosis, open-label/participant-blind infusion, pre–post/placebo-controlled design and the sex of patients. Results Effect sizes were significantly larger for repeat than single infusion at 4 h, 24 h and 7 days. For single infusion studies, effect sizes were large and significant at 4 h, 24 h and 7 days. The percentage of males was a predictor of antidepressant response at 7 days. Effect sizes for open-label and participant-blind infusions were not significantly different at any time point. Conclusions Single ketamine infusions elicit a significant antidepressant effect from 4 h to 7 days; the small number of studies at 12–14 days post infusion failed to reach significance. Results suggest a discrepancy in peak response time depending upon primary diagnosis — 24 h for MDD and 7 days for BD. The majority of published studies have used pre–post comparison; further placebo-controlled studies would help to clarify the effect of ketamine over time. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Intravenous (IV) subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been shown to reduce psychiatric distress in both major depressive (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effect of ketamine on cognitive function in these disorders is not well understood. To address this gap, we examined the effect of a single dose of IV ketamine on cognition in individuals with MDD and/or PTSD relative to healthy controls (HC). Psychiatric (n = 29; 15 PTSD, 14 MDD) and sex- age- and IQ matched HC (n = 29) groups were recruited from the community. A single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine was administered. Mood and cognitive measures were collected prior to, 2 h and 1 day post-ketamine administration. MDD/PTSD individuals evidenced a large-magnitude improvement in severity of depressive symptoms at both 2-hours and 1 day post-ketamine administration (p’s {$<$} .001, Cohen d’s = 0.80–1.02). Controlling for baseline performance and years of education, IV ketamine induced declines in attention (ATTN), executive function (EF), and verbal memory (VM) 2 h post-administration, all of which had resolved by 1 day post-ketamine across groups. The magnitude of cognitive decline was significantly larger in MDD/PTSD relative to HC on attention only (p = .012, d = 0.56). Ketamine did not affect working memory (WM) performance. Cognitive function (baseline, change from baseline to post-ketamine) was not associated with antidepressant response to ketamine. Results suggest that while ketamine may have an acute deleterious effect on some cognitive domains in both MDD/PTSD and HC individuals, most notably attention, this reduction is transient and there is no evidence of ketamine-related cognitive dysfunction at 1 day postadministration.},

  abstract = {Clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that depression, one of the most common psychiatric illnesses, is associated with reduced levels of neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), contributing to neuronal atrophy in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, and reduced hippocampal adult neurogenesis. Conventional monoaminergic antidepressants can block/reverse, at least partially, these deficits in part via induction of BDNF and/or VEGF, although these drugs have significant limitations, notably a time lag for therapeutic response and low response rates. Recent studies reveal that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist produces rapid (within hours) and sustained (up to a week) antidepressant actions in both patients with treatment-resistant depression and rodent models of depression. Rodent studies also demonstrate that ketamine rapidly increases BDNF and VEGF release and/or expression in the medial PFC (mPFC) and hippocampus, leading to increase in the number and function of spine synapses in the mPFC and enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis. These neurotrophic effects of ketamine are associated with the antidepressant effects of this drug. Together, these findings provide evidence for a neurotrophic mechanism underlying the rapid and sustained antidepressant actions of ketamine and pave the way for the development of rapid and more effective antidepressants with fewer side effects than ketamine.},

However, the potential for psychotherapy to normalize neurobiological responses to pleasant stimuli has not been evaluated. Methods: Twelve adults with and 15 adults without MDD participated in two identical functional magnetic resonance imaging scans that used a Wheel of Fortune task. Between scans, MDD outpatients received Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with rewarding stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors. Results: Seventy-five percent of adults with MDD were treatment responders, achieving post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of six or below. Relative to changes in brain function in the matched nondepressed group, psychotherapy resulted in functional changes in structures that mediate responses to rewards, including the paracingulate gyrus during reward selection, the right caudate nucleus (i.e., the dorsal striatum), during reward anticipation, and the paracingulate and orbital frontal gyri during reward feedback. There was no effect of diagnostic status or psychotherapy on in-scanner task-related behavioral responses. Conclusions: Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with rewarding stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors, results in improved functioning of unique reward structures during different temporal phases of responses to pleasurable stimuli, including the dorsal striatum during reward anticipation.},

Although numerous studies have examined the neural mechanisms that underlie the cognitive aspects of depression, their findings have not been integrated with Beck’s cognitive model. In this Review, we identify the functional and structural neurobiological architecture of Beck’s cognitive model of depression. Although the mechanisms underlying each element of the model differ, in general the negative cognitive biases in depression are facilitated by increased influence from subcortical emotion processing regions combined with attenuated top-down cognitive control.},

Acute treatment of psychotic unipolar depression generally involves the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic drug or electroconvulsive therapy. There is inadequate information about maintenance treatment of unipolar psychotic depression and acute and chronic treatment of psychotic bipolar disorder.

  abstract = {The pathophysiology and treatment of depression have been the focus of intense research and while there is much that remains unknown, modern neurobiological approaches are making progress. This work demonstrates that stress and depression are associated with atrophy of neurons and reduced synaptic connectivity in brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that contribute to depressive behaviors, and conversely that antidepressant treatment can reverse these deficits. The role of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), has been of particular interest as these factors play a key role in activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity. Here, we review the literature demonstrating that exposure to stress and depression decreases BDNF expression in the hippocampus and PFC and conversely that antidepressant treatment can up-regulate BDNF in the adult brain and reverse the effects of stress. We then focus on rapid-acting antidepressants, particularly the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which produces rapid synaptic and antidepressant behavioral actions that are dependent on activitydependent release of BDNF. This rapid release of BDNF differs from typical monoaminergic agents that require chronic administration to produce a slow induction of BDNF expression, consistent with the time lag for the therapeutic action of these agents. We review evidence that other classes of rapid-acting agents also require BDNF release, demonstrating that this is a common, convergent downstream mechanism. Finally, we discuss evidence that the actions of ketamine are also dependent on another growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its complex interplay with BDNF.},

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist produces a rapid antidepressant response (within hours) and is effective in treatment resistant depressed patients. Molecular and cellular studies in rodent models demonstrate that ketamine rapidly increases synaptogenesis, including increased density and function of spine synapses, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Ketamine also produces rapid antidepressant actions in behavioral models of depression, and reverses the deficits in synapse number and behavior resulting from chronic stress exposure. These effects of ketamine are accompanied by stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased levels of synaptic proteins. Together these studies indicate that ketamine rapidly reverses the atrophy of spines in the PFC and thereby causes a functional reconnection of neurons that underlies the rapid behavioral responses. These findings identify new targets for rapid acting antidepressants that are safer than ketamine.},

  abstract = {Depression is a complex and heterogeneous disorder whose cause is poorly understood. Theories on the mechanisms of the disease have often focused on either its neurobiology or its cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Recently, studies exploring how depressed patients process reward and punishment have linked these two facets together. It has been suggested that individuals with a dysfunction in a specialized network of brain regions are unable to exploit affective information to guide behavior. Deficits in this ability might predispose such individuals to develop depression, whereas subsequent restoration of this ability—whether through pharmacological or behavioral treatments—might enable recovery from the disorder. Here we review behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational findings relevant to this hypothesis. There is good evidence that depressed patients exhibit abnormal behavioral responses to rewards and punishments and that these tendencies correspond to aberrant function in frontostriatal systems modulated by the monoamine systems. Furthermore, computational studies have generated testable predictions for how these neural signaling and neurochemical abnormalities might contribute to the symptoms of depression. Combining these approaches—as well as molecular and behavioral work in animals—provides great promise for furthering our understanding of this common and debilitating disease.},

The aim was to determine how relapses could be prevented in this  frequently recessing disorder. The study was a two-phase, 12-month, multicentre  trial of patients suffering from major depression or dysthymia, diagnosed using  DSM-III criteria and evaluated on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and  the Mood, Anxiety, Retardation, Danger scale. Phase I was an open-label 3-month  period, with the patients being given 200 mg amineptine per day. The second, 9-month  period was a placebo-controlled prophylactic phase. A total of 458 patients were  initially included in the study. Of the 376 who completed phase I, 303 (66\%) were  responders; 284 entered the prophylactic study, randomly assigned to two groups. Of  the 134 patients in the placebo group who completed phase II, 25 (18.7\%) suffered a  relapse, compared with nine out of the 136 (6.6\%) in the amineptine group. After  resolution of an acute episode of major depression or dysthymia, long-term  antidepressant therapy with amineptine significantly reduced the relapse rate.},

These studies have focused primarily on schizophrenia, and less so on the affective psychoses, including psychotic major depression PMD. Several studies have provided evidence of cognitive dysfunction in PMD. However, these studies have utilized different assessment methods and instruments. Consequently, a clear picture of the nature and severity of cognitive impairment in PMD has yet to emerge in the literature. The current review seeks to provide a summary of the literature by composing a quantitative and qualitative review of the research to date on the cognitive impairment in psychotic major depression, specifically as it contrasts to those deficits observed in nonpsychotic depression. This review also provides a summary model of the pathophysiology of PMD to provide the necessary context to understanding the biological mechanisms of these impairments.},

A second question was whether maintaining antidepressant medication at  the dosage used to treat the acute episode rather than decreasing to a "maintenance"  dosage would provide prophylaxis superior to that observed in earlier trials in  which a maintenance dosage strategy was employed. Survival analysis demonstrated a  highly significant prophylactic effect for active imipramine hydrochloride  maintained at an average dose of 200 mg and a modest prophylactic effect for monthly  interpersonal psychotherapy. We conclude that active imipramine hydrochloride  maintained at an average dose of 200 mg is an effective means of preventing  recurrence and that monthly interpersonal psychotherapy serves to lengthen the time  between episodes in patients not receiving active medication.},

We also evaluate if both ketamine and esketamine as one group influence cognition in patients with TRD. Fifty-four patients with TRD were infused with either ketamine or esketamine and were assessed at three time points: baseline, 24h, and 7 days after infusion. We applied neuropsychological tests to evaluate executive functions, processing speed, short term memory, and auditory-verbal episodic memory. There is no cognitive difference between ketamine and esketamine, with the exception of one variable. When considered as one group, ketamine and esketamine do not impair cognition; on the contrary, they improve some neuropsychological functions such as visuospatial short-term memory, executive functions, processing speed, and several measures related to episodic verbal memory. Ketamine and esketamine do not present differing cognitive effects when used in antidepressant doses to treat TRD. Furthermore, they rapidly improve many cognitive aspects of patients with TRD at 24h after the infusion and maintain these effects for at least 7 days.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences is recommended for chronic  forms of major depressive disorder (MDD), but few studies have examined maintenance  efficacy of antidepressants with chronic MDD. This randomized, placebo-controlled  study of the efficacy and safety of nefazodone in preventing recurrence was  conducted for patients with chronic MDD. METHODS: A total of 165 outpatients with  chronic, nonpsychotic MDD, MDD plus dysthymic disorder ("double-depression"), or  recurrent MDD with incomplete inter-episode recovery, who achieved and maintained a  clinical response during acute and continuation treatment with either nefazodone  alone or nefazodone combined with psychotherapy, were randomized to 52 weeks of  double-blind nefazodone (maximum dose 600 mg/day) or placebo. The occurrence of  major depressive episodes during maintenance treatment was assessed with the 24-item  Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, a DSM-IV MDD checklist, and a blinded review  of symptom exacerbations by a consensus committee of research clinicians. RESULTS:  Application of a competing-risk model that estimated the conditional probability of  recurrence among those patients remaining on active therapy revealed a significant  (p =.043) difference between nefazodone (n = 76) and placebo (n = 74) when the  latter part of the 1-year maintenance period was emphasized. At the end of 1 year,  the conditional probability of recurrence was 30.3\% for nefazodone-treated patients,  compared with 47.5\% for placebo-treated patients. Prior concomitant psychotherapy  during acute/continuation treatment, although enhancing the initial response, was  not associated with lower recurrence rates. Discontinuations due to adverse events  were relatively low for both nefazodone (5.3\%) and placebo (4.8\%). Somnolence was  significantly greater among the patients taking active medication (15.4\%), compared  with placebo (4.6\%). CONCLUSIONS: Nefazodone is well-tolerated and is an effective  maintenance therapy for chronic forms of MDD.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

  abstract = {Optimal outcomes from depression treatment are long-term recovery and, in the case of recurrent depression, prevention of new episodes. However, few data are available concerning the long-term efficacy of antidepressants in prophylactic treatment to prevent recurrences of depression. The efficacy and safety of fluoxetine 20 mg/day was evaluated in reducing the number of depressive episodes and in extending the time free of symptoms in patients with recurrent unipolar major depression. Patients with recurrent unipolar major depression according to DSM-III-R criteria and who responded to 32 weeks of open-label fluoxetine were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine 20 mg/day (N = 70) or placebo (N = 70) for 48 weeks of double-blind maintenance treatment. Outcome measures were the percentage of recurrences and time to recurrence. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, reasons for discontinuation, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Fluoxetine was associated with a statistically significantly smaller percentage of patients who had a recurrence compared with placebo (20\% vs. 40\%; X2 analysis, p = 0.010). The symptom-free period was significantly longer for patients treated with fluoxetine versus placebo (295 vs. 192 days; Kaplan-Meier estimates, logrank test, p = 0.002). Treatments were well tolerated during maintenance treatment. The only statistically significant difference in adverse events between treatment groups was anxiety, which was more frequent in the placebo group (fluoxetine, 12.9\% vs. placebo, 30\%; X2 analysis, p = 0.013).

  abstract = {Background: Depression is characterized by cognitive impairments, including executive dysfunctions. These executive deficits could reflect impairments of more basic executive processes, such as updating, set shifting and inhibition. While shifting and inhibition impairments are often reported, studies on depression have been somewhat obscure about specific deficits of the updating process. The main goal of that study was to assess the updating process in young in-patients with depression. Methods: We used a verbal n-back task to assess updating process. Load and mental manipulation within working memory (WM) were incremented by using three different levels of complexity (1,2,3-back). Neuropsychological tests and an attentional task (0-back) were also administered to subjects. Twenty-two individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Unipolar Depression and 22 healthy control subjects, matched on age, verbal IQ and education, were included in the study. Results: Subjects with depression showed significant deficits at the n-back task compared to control subjects. They were normal in tasks assessing the short-term maintenance in WM and attention. This suggests that depressed patients exhibit impairment in the updating process. Depressed patients also showed set shifting and inhibition deficits. Only the n-back task was correlated with the number of hospitalizations and the longitudinal course of the illness. Conclusions: Our results suggest that young depressed in-patients have widespread executive dysfunctions, including updating, shifting and inhibition processes. We also found a correlation between a longitudinal measure of depression severity and an updating task performance. We suggest that using multiple executive tasks gives the opportunity to distinguish the specific influence of various executive processes on clinical dimensions in depression.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Approximately one-third of the patients with MDD are treatment resistant to the current antidepressants. There is also a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. Furthermore, depression in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) is typically poorly responsive to antidepressants. Therefore, there exists an unmet medical need for rapidly acting antidepressants with beneficial effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Because (S)-ketamine has higher affinity for NMDAR than (R)-ketamine, esketamine was developed as an antidepressant. On 5 March 2019, esketamine nasal spray was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, preclinical data suggest that (R)-ketamine exerts greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression and that (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side-effects than (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine. In this article, the author reviews the historical overview of the antidepressant actions of enantiomers of ketamine and its major metabolites norketamine and hydroxynorketamine. Furthermore, the author discusses the other potential rapid-acting antidepressant candidates (i.e., NMDAR antagonists and modulators, low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channel inhibitor, potassium channel Kir4.1 inhibitor, negative modulators of γ-aminobutyric acid, and type A [GABAA] receptors) to compare them with ketamine. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ketamine’s antidepressant effects are discussed.},

Diverse studies suggest that different antidepressant agents may improve cognitive functions in patients with MDD. The aim of this work is to study the effects of serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonergic–noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) treatments to improve the performance on memory tasks and mental processing speed in MDD. Seventy-three subjects meeting criteria for major depressive disorder were assessed with the Hamilton depression rating scale and a neuropsychological battery. The subjects were medicated with escitalopram (n = 36) or duloxetine (n = 37) for 24 weeks. At the end of the trial, the subjects were assessed again with the same neuropsychological battery used prior to the treatment. Both treatments improved importantly the episodic memory and to a lesser extent, working memory, mental processing speed and motor performance. Our results suggest that cognition is partially independent from improvement in clinical symptoms. Both groups achieved remission rates in the HAM-D-17 after 24 weeks of treatment, but SNRI was superior to SSRI at improving episodic and working memory. Our work indicates that the superiority of SNRI over the SSRI at episodic memory improvement is clinically relevant.},

Method: Seventy-one women and 13 men (N = 84) with partially remitted major depression after treatment were randomly assigned to either 10 weeks of Internet-based CBT or to a control group. Self-help material was used in combination with e-mail contact with a personal therapist.

Results: Significantly fewer participants in the CBT group experienced relapse (4 ⁄ 38 or 10.5\%) compared with those in the control group (14 ⁄ 37 or 37.8\%). The difference in relapse rates between groups occurred early in the study period and was still apparent after 6 months. A trend towards a larger reduction in depressive symptoms was observed at post-treatment in the participants who received CBT compared with controls. Reduction in depressive symptoms reduced the risk of relapse. A trend towards a higher remission rate was found in the CBT group at the 6 month follow-up.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the effects of ketamine on frontal and hippocampal responses to memory encoding and retrieval in healthy volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subjects comparison of two doses of intravenous ketamine. Dissociation of the effects of ketamine on encoding and retrieval processes was achieved using two study-test cycles: in the first, items were encoded prior to drug infusion and retrieval tested, during scanning, on drug; in the second, encoding was scanned on drug, and retrieval tested once ketamine plasma levels had declined. We additionally determined the interaction of ketamine with the depth of processing that occurred at encoding. A number of effects upon task-dependent activations were seen. Overall, our results suggest that left frontal activation is augmented by ketamine when elaborative semantic processing is required at encoding. In addition, successful encoding on ketamine is supplemented by additional non-verbal processing that is incidental to task demands. The effects of ketamine at retrieval are consistent with impaired access to accompanying contextual features of studied items. Our findings show that, even when overt behaviour is unimpaired, ketamine has an impact upon the recruitment of key regions in episodic memory task performance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of "Keeping the blues away" (KBA), a manualised depression relapse prevention program for general practice, in reducing the relapse of depression compared with usual care (with the aim of halving the relapse rate), and in reducing depression severity and improving the process of care. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in 2004-2005 in South Australian general practices. PARTICIPANTS: 43 general practitioners from 23 urban and rural practices recruited 110 patients with depression (age range, 18-75 years). INTERVENTION: GP training manual or patient manual and relaxation CD; 20 hours of training on depression, the study protocol, assessment tools and skills. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risk (RR) of depression relapse; depression severity and quality of life scores. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in relapse rates between the groups (chi(2)(1) = 1.51; P = 0.23), although there was a non-significant tendency for relapse to be reduced in the KBA group (RR = 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.50-2.05). Older patients ({$>$} or = 50 years) in the KBA group showed a significantly lower probability of relapse than those in the control group (P = 0.018). There was a decrease in depression scores in both groups. KBA participants had more severe depression at baseline, and the reduction in severity in those with symptoms for {$>$} 6 months was nearly significant (P = 0.06). KBA was positively received by GPs and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although this pilot study of a small sample did not achieve its primary outcome of reducing depression relapse by 50\%, KBA was found to be a promising program for older patients and for those with more severe or persistent symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and maintenance  antidepressant medication (mADM) both reduce the risk of relapse in recurrent  depression, but their combination has not been studied. Our aim was to investigate  whether the addition of MBCT to mADM is a more effective prevention strategy than  mADM alone. METHODS: This study is one of two multicenter randomised trials  comparing the combination of MBCT and mADM to either intervention on its own. In the  current trial, recurrently depressed patients in remission who had been using mADM  for 6 months or longer (n=68), were randomly allocated to either MBCT+mADM (n=33) or  mADM alone (n=35). Primary outcome was depressive relapse/recurrence within 15  months. Key secondary outcomes were time to relapse/recurrence and depression  severity. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat. RESULTS: There were no  significant differences between the groups on any of the outcome measures.  LIMITATIONS: The current study included patients who had recovered from depression  with mADM and who preferred the certainty of continuing medication to the  possibility of participating in MBCT. Lower expectations of mindfulness in the  current trial, compared with the parallel trial, may have caused selection bias. In  addition, recruitment was hampered by the increasing availability of MBCT in the  Netherlands, and even about a quarter of participants included in the trial who were  allocated to the control group chose to get MBCT elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: For this  selection of recurrently depressed patients in remission and using mADM for 6 months  or longer, MBCT did not further reduce their risk for relapse/recurrence or their  (residual) depressive symptoms.},

AIMS: To investigate whether  MBCT with discontinuation of mADM is non-inferior to MBCT+mADM. METHOD: A  multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial  (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT00928980). Adults with recurrent depression in remission,  using mADM for 6 months or longer (n= 249), were randomly allocated to either  discontinue (n= 128) or continue (n= 121) mADM after MBCT. The primary outcome was  depressive relapse/recurrence within 15 months. A confidence interval approach with  a margin of 25\% was used to test non-inferiority. Key secondary outcomes were time  to relapse/recurrence and depression severity. RESULTS: The difference in  relapse/recurrence rates exceeded the non-inferiority margin and time to  relapse/recurrence was significantly shorter after discontinuation of mADM. There  were only minor differences in depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  suggest an increased risk of relapse/recurrence in patients withdrawing from mADM  after MBCT.},

We predicted that couples receiving a behavioral couple  treatment would be less likely to relapse than those receiving a  cognitive-behavioral treatment for the depressed spouse alone. Relapse rates,  however, did not discriminate between treatments at any follow-up point. Reductions  in husband and wife dysphoria and increases in wife facilitative behavior during  therapy predicted recovery. Moreover, high rates of husbands' facilitative behavior  at posttest were associated with wife recovery and predicted low levels of  depression at the 1-year follow-up.},

Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world’s population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data.},

  abstract = {Objective: We investigated patient and disease characteristics predictive of relapse of MDD during a 52week placebo controlled trial of selegiline transdermal system (STS) to identify patient characteristics relevant for STS treatment. Method: After 10 weeks of open-label stabilization with STS, 322 remitted patients with MDD were randomized to 52-weeks of double-blind treatment with STS (6 mg/24 h) or placebo (PLB). Relapse was defined as Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score of Z14 and a CGI-S score of Z 3 with at least 2-point increase from the beginning of the double blind phase on 2 consecutive visits. Cox's proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effect of potential predictors (age, sex, age at onset of first MDD, early response pattern, number of previous antidepressant trials, severity of index episode, number of previous episodes, melancholic features, atypical features and anxious feature) on outcome. Exploratory analyses examined additional clinical variables (medical history, other psychiatric history, and individual items of HAM-D 28) on relapse. Results: For all predictor variables analyzed, treatment Hazard Ratio (HR¼ 0.48   0.54) was significantly in favor of STS (i.e., lower relapse risk than PLB). Age of onset was significantly predictive of relapse. Type, duration, and severity of depressive episodes, previous antidepressant trials, or demographic variables did not predict relapse. In additional exploratory analysis, eating disorder history and suicidal ideation were significant predictors of relapse after controlling for the effect of treatment in individual predictor analysis. Conclusions: While age of onset, eating disorder history and suicidal ideation were significant predictors, the majority of clinical and demographic variables were not predictive of relapse. Given the post-hoc nature of analysis, the findings need confirmation from a prospective study. It appears that selegiline transdermal system was broadly effective in preventing relapse across different subtypes and symptoms clusters of MDD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be an effective  acute antidepressant treatment, few studies systematically examine persistence of  benefit. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the durability of antidepressant effect after acute  response to TMS in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using  protocol-specified maintenance antidepressant monotherapy. METHODS: Three hundred  one patients were randomly assigned to active or sham TMS in a 6-week, controlled  trial. Nonresponders could enroll in a second, 6-week, open-label study. Patients  who met criteria for partial response (i.e., {$>$}25\% decrease from the baseline HAMD  17) during either the sham-controlled or open-label study (n = 142) were tapered off  TMS over 3 weeks, while simultaneously starting maintenance antidepressant  monotherapy. Patients were then followed for 24 weeks in a naturalistic follow-up  study examining the long-term durability of TMS. During this durability study, TMS  was readministered if patients met prespecified criteria for symptom worsening  (i.e., a change of at least one point on the CGI-S scale for 2 consecutive weeks).  Relapse was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Ten of 99 (10\%; Kaplan-Meier  survival estimate = 12.9\%) patients relapsed. Thirty-eight (38.4\%) patients met  criteria for symptom worsening and 32/38 (84.2\%) reachieved symptomatic benefit with  adjunctive TMS. Safety and tolerability were similar to acute TMS monotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: These initial data suggest that the therapeutic effects of TMS are  durable and that TMS may be successfully used as an intermittent rescue strategy to  preclude impending relapse.},

  abstract = {The discovery of the rapid antidepressant effects of the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine, an uncompetitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist, is arguably the most important breakthrough in depression research in the last 50\,years. Ketamine remains an off-label treatment for treatment-resistant depression with factors that limit widespread use including its dissociative effects and abuse potential. Ketamine is a racemic mixture, composed of equal amounts of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine. An (S)-ketamine nasal spray has been developed and approved for use in treatment-resistant depression in the United States and Europe; however, some concerns regarding efficacy and side effects remain. Although (R)-ketamine is a less potent N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist than (S)-ketamine, increasing preclinical evidence suggests (R)-ketamine may have more potent and longer lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine, alongside fewer side effects. Furthermore, a recent pilot trial of (R)-ketamine has demonstrated rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Research is ongoing to determine the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of ketamine and its component enantiomers in an effort to develop future rapid-acting antidepressants that lack undesirable effects. Here, we briefly review findings regarding the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomers before considering underlying mechanisms including N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonism, γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneuron inhibition, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic receptor activation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin kinase B signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and inhibition of lateral habenula bursting, alongside potential roles of the monoaminergic and opioid receptor systems.},

  abstract = {The underlying neurobiological basis of major depressive disorder remains elusive due to the severity, complexity, and heterogeneity of the disorder. While the traditional monoaminergic hypothesis has largely fallen short in its ability to provide a complete picture of major depressive disorder, emerging preclinical and clinical findings suggest that dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission may underlie the pathophysiology of both major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. In particular, recent studies showing that a single intravenous infusion of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine elicits fastacting, robust, and relatively sustained antidepressant, antisuicidal, and antianhedonic effects in individuals with treatmentresistant depression have prompted tremendous interest in understanding the mechanisms responsible for ketamine’s clinical efficacy. These results, coupled with new evidence of the mechanistic processes underlying ketamine’s effects, have led to inventive ways of investigating, repurposing, and expanding research into novel glutamate-based therapeutic targets with superior antidepressant effects but devoid of dissociative side effects. Ketamine’s targets include noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor inhibition, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid throughput potentiation coupled with downstream signaling changes, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor targets localized on gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneurons. Here, we review ketamine and other potentially novel glutamate-based treatments for treatmentresistant depression, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, glycine binding site ligands, metabotropic glutamate receptor modulators, and other glutamatergic modulators. Both the putative mechanisms of action of these agents and clinically relevant studies are described.},

Adult out-patients with a recurrent episode of moderate major depression, a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score ≥20 and ≥3 previous episodes in 5 years participated. After 6 weeks of single-blind treatment with 3 × 300 mg/day WS® 5570 patients with score ≤2 on item 'Improvement' of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale and a HAMD total score decrease ≥50\% versus baseline were randomized to 3 × 300 mg/day WS® 5570 or placebo for 26 weeks. 426 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Relapse rates during continuation treatment were 51/282 (18.1\%) for WS® 5570 and 37/144 (25.7\%) for placebo. Average time to relapse was 177 ± 2.8 and 163 ± 4.4 days for WS® 5570 and placebo, respectively (time-to-event analysis; p = 0.034; α = 0.025 one-sided). Patients treated with WS® 5570 showed more favorable HAMD and Beck Depression Inventory time courses and greater over-all improvement (CGI) than those randomized to placebo. In long-term maintenance treatment a pronounced prophylactic effect of WS® 5570 was observed in patients with an early onset of depression as well as in those with a high degree of chronicity. Adverse event rates under WS® 5570 were comparable to placebo. WS® 5570 showed a beneficial effect in preventing relapse after recovery from acute depression. Tolerability in continuation and long-term maintenance treatment was on the placebo level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg/day in the prevention of depressive recurrence in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Patients having at least three episodes of MDD in the past 5 years received open-label (OL) duloxetine 60-120 mg/day for up to 34 weeks. Patients meeting response criteria were then randomised to either duloxetine or placebo for up to 52 weeks of double-blind maintenance treatment. Only patients taking duloxetine 60 mg/day during the OL phase, and randomised to either duloxetine (remained on 60 mg/day dose) or placebo, were included in this post hoc analysis. The primary outcome measure was time to recurrence of a major depressive episode. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD 17) was used to evaluate depressive symptomatology. Global and physical functioning and pain were also assessed. Safety and tolerability were assessed via analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs and weight. Results: A total of 124 patients were randomised to duloxetine 60 mg/day (n = 64) or placebo (n = 60). Time to depressive recurrence was significantly longer in duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (p = 0.001). During the double-blind maintenance phase, 31.7\% of placebo-treated patients experienced a depressive recurrence compared with 12.5\% of duloxetine-treated patients (p = 0.004). The HAMD17 total score and most of its subscales as well as the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S), significantly worsened in the placebo group compared with the duloxetine 60 mg/day group. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in TEAEs, discontinuations because of adverse events, vital signs or weight. Conclusions: Treatment with duloxetine 60 mg/day was associated with a longer time to depressive recurrence and a significantly lower recurrence rate compared with placebo. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine if  maintenance therapy with sertraline hydrochloride can effectively prevent recurrence  of depression in the high-risk group of patients experiencing chronic major  depression or major depression with antecedent dysthymic disorder ("double  depression"). DESIGN: A 76-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study,  conducted from September 1993 to November 1996. SETTING: Outpatient psychiatric  clinics at 10 academic medical centers and 2 clinical research centers.  INTERVENTION: Maintenance treatment with either sertraline hydrochloride (n = 77) in  flexible doses up to 200 mg or placebo (n = 84). PATIENTS: A total of 161  outpatients with chronic major or double depression who responded to sertraline in a  12-week, double-blind, acute-phase treatment trial and continued to have a  satisfactory therapeutic response during a subsequent 4-month continuation phase.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to recurrence of major depression. RESULTS: Sertraline  afforded significantly greater prophylaxis against recurrence than did placebo (5  [6\%] of 77 in the sertraline group vs 19 [23\%] of 84 in the placebo group; P = .002  for the log-rank test of time-to-recurrence distributions). Clinically significant  depressive symptoms reemerged in 20 (26\%) of 77 patients treated with sertraline vs  42 (50\%) of 84 patients who received placebo (P = .001). With use of a Cox  proportional hazards model, patients receiving placebo were 4.07 times more likely  (95\% CI, 1.51-10.95; P = .005) to experience a depression recurrence, after  adjustment for study site, type of depression, and randomization strata.  CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance therapy with sertraline is well tolerated and has  significant efficacy in preventing recurrence or reemergence of depression in  chronically depressed patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: To report second-year results from the 2-year maintenance phase of a long-term study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine extended release (ER) in preventing recurrence of depression. Method: Outpatients with recurrent unipolar depression (DSM-IV criteria; N = 1096) were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 10 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine ER or fluoxetine. Responders (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D17] total score ≤ 12 and ≥ 50\% decrease from baseline) entered a 6-month, double-blind continuation phase on the same medication. Continuation-phase responders were enrolled into maintenance treatment consisting of 2 consecutive 12-month phases. At the start of each maintenance phase, venlafaxine ER responders were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with venlafaxine ER or placebo, and fluoxetine responders were continued for each period. The second 12-month maintenance phase compared the time to recurrence of depression with venlafaxine ER (75 to 300 mg/day) versus placebo as the primary efficacy measure. The primary definition of recurrence was a HAM-D17 total score {$>$} 12 and {$<$} 50\% reduction from baseline (acute phase) at 2 consecutive visits or at the last valid visit prior to discontinuation. The time to recurrence was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between the venlafaxine ER and placebo groups using log-rank tests. Secondary outcome measures included rates of response and remission (defined as HAM-D17 ≤ 7). The study was conducted from December 2000 through July 2005. Results: The cumulative probabilities of recurrence through 12 months in the venlafaxine ER (N = 43) and placebo (N = 40) groups were 8.0\% (95\% CI = 0.0 to 16.8) and 44.8\% (95\% CI = 27.6 to 62.0), respectively (p {$<$} .001). At month 12, using last-observation-carried-forward analysis, the rate of response or remission was significantly higher in the venlafaxine ER group (93\%) than in the placebo group (63\%; p = .002). Overall discontinuation rates were 28\% and 63\% in the venlafaxine ER and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were the primary reason for discontinuation for 1 patient (2\%) in the venlafaxine ER group and 4 (10\%) in the placebo group. An analysis of the combined maintenance phases, which compared the risk of recurrence over 24 months for patients assigned to venlafaxine ER (N = 129) or placebo (N = 129) for the first maintenance phase, showed a significantly greater cumulative probability of recurrence through 24 months for the placebo group (47.3\% [95\% CI = 36.4 to 58.2]) than for the venlafaxine ER group (28.5\% [95\% CI = 18.3 to 38.7]; p = .005). Conclusion: In this study, an additional 12 months of maintenance therapy with venlafaxine ER was effective in preventing recurrence of depression in patients who had been responders to venlafaxine ER after acute (10 weeks), continuation (6 months), and initial maintenance (12 months) therapy.

  abstract = {Objective: This study followed remitted patients from a randomized controlled trial of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The aims were to describe rates of recurrence and to evaluate 3 clinical predictor domains. Method: Ninety-four treatment-naïve patients (50\% female; Mage = 38.1 years; 48.9\% White; 30.9\% Hispanic) with MDD who had remitted to 12-week monotherapy (escitalopram, duloxetine, or cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]) participated in a 21-month maintenance phase (i.e., continued medication or 3 possible CBT booster sessions per year). Recurrence was assessed quarterly, and the clinical predictors were the following: 2 measures of residual depressive symptoms, 1 measure of lifetime depressive episodes, and 2 measures of baseline anxiety. Survival analysis models evaluated recurrence rates, and regression models evaluated the predictors. Results: Among all patients, 15.5\% experienced a recurrence, and the survival distributions did not statistically differ among treatments. Residual depressive symptoms on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the end of monotherapy were associated with increased risk for recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.31, 95\% confidence interval [CI: 1.02, 1.67], Wald I ‡2 = 4.41, p =.036), and not having a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis at study baseline reduced the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio =.31, 95\% CI [.10,.94], Wald I ‡2 = 4.28, p =.039). Conclusions: The study supported the benefits of maintenance treatment for treatment-naïve patients who remitted to initial monotherapy; nevertheless, remitted patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis at the beginning of treatment or residual depressive symptoms after initial treatment were at risk for poorer long-Term outcomes.

This study was designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous (IV) ketamine injection in controlling depressive symptoms in comparison with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in major depressed disordered patients. Materials and Methods: Thirty‑two patients over 18 years of age who were candidates for ECT were enrolled in the study. They were allocated into two groups using block design randomization. Sixteen patients received IV infusion of 0.5‑mg/kg ketamine and 16 patients underwent a bitemporal ECT. To evaluate the changes in depression severity, researchers administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline, before each treatment session, and four time points posttreatment (week 1 and months 1, 2, and 3). The Wechsler Memory Scale was used to evaluate the cognitive state of patients in week 1, month 1, and month 3 of the treatment. Results: The HDRS showed improvement in depressive symptoms in both the groups with no statistically significant difference. Cognitive state was more favorable (but not significant) in the ketamine group (P {$>$} 0.5). Conclusion: Treatment with IV ketamine in depressed people has the same antidepressant effects as ECT treatment without any memory deficiency.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic depressions are common, disabling and under-treated, and  long-term treatment is little studied. We report the continuation phase results from  a long-term treatment study. METHODS: After 12 weeks of acute phase treatment in a  double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multi-center trial of sertraline or  imipramine, patients with chronic depression ({$>$} or = 2 years in major depression, or  major depression superimposed on dysthymia) continued study drug for 16 weeks.  Initially, 635 patients were randomized to sertraline or imipramine in a 2:1 ratio.  Nonresponders after 12 weeks entered a 12-week double-blind crossover trial of the  alternate medication. Entry into continuation treatment required at least a  satisfactory response (partial remission) to initial or crossover treatment.  RESULTS: Of 239 acute or crossover responders to sertraline, 60\% entered  continuation in full remission and 40\% with a partial remission. These proportions  were identical for imipramine patients (n = 147). For both drug groups, over  two-thirds of those entering in full remission retained it. For those entering in  partial remission, over 40\% achieved full remission. Patients requiring crossover  treatment were less likely to maintain or improve their response during continuation  treatment. The two drugs did not differ significantly in response distribution, drop  out rates or discontinuation due to side effects during continuation treatment.  LIMITATIONS: The absence of a placebo group constrains interpretation of our  results, but chronic depressions have low placebo response rates. CONCLUSIONS: Most  chronic depression patients who remit with 12 weeks of sertraline or imipramine  treatment maintain remission during 16 weeks of continuation treatment. Most  patients with a satisfactory therapeutic response (partial remission) after 12 weeks  of treatment maintain it or further improve. Patients treated with imipramine  experienced more side effects, but both drugs were well tolerated.},

  abstract = {The need for maintenance therapy in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is underscored by the high likelihood of recurrence after short-term treatment. Current recommendations include treatment to remission and long-term treatment to prevent relapse and recurrence. This article will summarize the design and results of the Prevention of Recurrent Episodes of Depression with Venlafaxine for Two Years (PREVENT) study, which have been published elsewhere. PREVENT evaluated venlafaxine extended release (ER) versus placebo in two 1-year maintenance phases for prevention of recurrence in patients with MDD who responded to acute and continuation therapy. Venlafaxine ER was effective in preventing long-term recurrence when compared with placebo, with a significant reduction in likelihood of recurrence and significantly longer time to recurrence after both 1 and 2 years of maintenance therapy. Recurrence rates in the first and second maintenance periods for patients receiving placebo were similar (42 vs 45\%), but recurrence rates for patients receiving venlafaxine ER decreased dramatically (23 vs 8\%). The PREVENT study adds to current understanding regarding the benefits of long-term antidepressant therapy in preventing recurrence. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

Recordings of local field potentials and unitary neuronal activity in the hippocampal CA1 area revealed altered theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) in freely behaving NR1PVCreÀ/À mice. Moreover, in contrast to controls, in NR1PVCreÀ/À mice the remaining theta rhythm was abolished by the administration of atropine. Gamma oscillations (35-85 Hz) were increased and less modulated by the concurrent theta rhythm in the mutant. Positional firing of pyramidal cells in NR1PVCreÀ/À mice was less spatially and temporally precise. Finally, NR1PVCreÀ/À mice exhibited impaired spatial working as well as spatial short- and long-term recognition memory but showed no deficits in open field exploratory activity and spatial reference learning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with a history of recurrent depression have a high risk of  repeated depressive relapse or recurrence. Maintenance antidepressants for at least  2 years is the current recommended treatment, but many individuals are interested in  alternatives to medication. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been  shown to reduce risk of relapse or recurrence compared with usual care, but has not  yet been compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in a definitive trial.  We aimed to see whether MBCT with support to taper or discontinue antidepressant  treatment (MBCT-TS) was superior to maintenance antidepressants for prevention of  depressive relapse or recurrence over 24 months. METHODS: In this single-blind,  parallel, group randomised controlled trial (PREVENT), we recruited adult patients  with three or more previous major depressive episodes and on a therapeutic dose of  maintenance antidepressants, from primary care general practices in urban and rural  settings in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT-TS or  maintenance antidepressants (in a 1:1 ratio) with a computer-generated random number  sequence with stratification by centre and symptomatic status. Participants were  aware of treatment allocation and research assessors were masked to treatment  allocation. The primary outcome was time to relapse or recurrence of depression,  with patients followed up at five separate intervals during the 24-month study  period. The primary analysis was based on the principle of intention to treat. The  trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN26666654. FINDINGS:  Between March 23, 2010, and Oct 21, 2011, we assessed 2188 participants for  eligibility and recruited 424 patients from 95 general practices. 212 patients were  randomly assigned to MBCT-TS and 212 to maintenance antidepressants. The time to  relapse or recurrence of depression did not differ between MBCT-TS and maintenance  antidepressants over 24 months (hazard ratio 0·89, 95\% CI 0·67-1·18; p=0·43), nor  did the number of serious adverse events. Five adverse events were reported,  including two deaths, in each of the MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants groups.  No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial.  INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance  antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals at  risk for depressive relapse or recurrence. Both treatments were associated with  enduring positive outcomes in terms of relapse or recurrence, residual depressive  symptoms, and quality of life.

  abstract = {Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an efficacious psychosocial intervention for recurrent depression (Kuyken et al., 2008; Ma \& Teasdale, 2004; Teasdale et al., 2000). To date, no compelling research addresses MBCT's mechanisms of change. This study determines whether MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment, and/or by alterations in post-treatment cognitive reactivity. The study was embedded in a randomized controlled trial comparing MBCT with maintenance antidepressants (mADM) with 15-month follow-up (Kuyken et al., 2008). Mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed before and after MBCT treatment (or at equivalent time points in the mADM group). Post-treatment reactivity was assessed one month after the MBCT group sessions or at the equivalent time point in the mADM group. One hundred and twenty-three patients with ≥3 prior depressive episodes, and successfully treated with antidepressants, were randomized either to mADM or MBCT. The MBCT arm involved participation in MBCT, a group-based psychosocial intervention that teaches mindfulness skills, and discontinuation of ADM. The mADM arm involved maintenance on a therapeutic ADM dose for the duration of follow-up. Interviewer-administered outcome measures assessed depressive symptoms and relapse/recurrence across 15-month follow-up. Mindfulness and self-compassion were measured using self-report questionnaire. Cognitive reactivity was operationalized as change in depressive thinking during a laboratory mood induction. MBCT's effects were mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment. MBCT also changed the nature of the relationship between post-treatment cognitive reactivity and outcome. Greater reactivity predicted worse outcome for mADM participants but this relationship was not evident in the MBCT group.MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by augmented self-compassion and mindfulness, along with a decoupling of the relationship between reactivity of depressive thinking and poor outcome. This decoupling is associated with the cultivation of self-compassion across treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

MBCT was more effective than m-ADM in reducing residual depressive symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity and in improving quality of life in the physical and psychological domains. There was no difference in average annual cost between the 2 groups. Rates of ADM usage in the MBCT group was significantly reduced, and 46 patients (75\%) completely discontinued their ADM.

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA’s such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between withinand between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

The drug  treatment consisted of two randomized trials which were both extended into the  post-ECT continuation phase. Patients with electrocardiological impairment were  randomized to either 30 mg paroxetine daily or placebo under blind conditions.  Patients without electrocardiological impairment were randomized to either 30 mg  paroxetine daily or 150 mg imipramine daily. There was a high level of agreement  between the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Melancholia Scale, demonstrating that  the patients treated with ECT plus imipramine in the acute phase showed greater  symptom reduction than those treated with ECT plus paroxetine. However, in the  post-ECT phase paroxetine was superior to both imipramine and placebo in preventing  relapse. Thus in the post-ECT phase 65\% of the placebo-treated patients relapsed,  compared to 30\% of the imipramine-treated patients and 10\% of the paroxetine-treated  patients. The psychometric analysis of the Melancholia Scale in the continuation or  post-ECT phase showed that relapsing patients displayed a pattern with lack of  interests, impaired concentration, depressed mood and anxiety among the less severe  symptoms (first-compartment symptoms). In other words, these symptoms represent the  gate to full-blown depression (second-compartment symptoms). Serotonin-selective  antidepressants such as paroxetine appear to be more effective in controlling the  first-compartment symptoms.},

  abstract = {The rapid antidepressant response after ketamine administration in treatment resistant depressed patients suggests a possible new approach for treating mood disorders compared to the weeks or months required for standard medications. However, the mechanisms underlying this action of ketamine have not been identified. We observed that ketamine rapidly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to increased synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rat. Moreover, blockade of mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine-induction of synaptogenesis and behavioral responses in models of depression. Our results demonstrate that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the fast antidepressant actions of ketamine.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. Method: Patients with anxious (n = 30) and nonanxious TRD (n = 20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. Results: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p {$<$} 0.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p = 0.028). However, no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD. Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD, and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD. Limitation: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. Conclusion: After six ketamine infusions, neurocognitive improvement was observed in patients with anxious TRD but not in patients with nonanxious TRD.},

If the results of shortterm memory assessment in depressed patients are equivocal, a general consensus exists that memory problems are secondary to attentional dysfunctions, and reflect the inability to concentrate. Moreover, both unipolar and bipolar patients show evidence of impaired verbal learning that has been commonly interpreted as reflecting an inability to transfer information from short-term to long-term storage. According to some authors, there would be a gender-related as well age-related specificity of some disturbances. Depressed patients also show impairments of executive functions and their recent exploration through brain imaging techniques has recently permitted to formulate some general hypotheses on the possible involvement of different brain areas in MD.},

In a discriminant function analysis that well-differentiated the HD, AD, and normal subjects, it was found that 28.6\% of the depressed patients were classified as HD patients (DEP-HD subjects), 49.0\% were classified as normals (DEP-N subjects), none were classified as AD patients, and 22.4\% were not well-classified. The DEPHD group closely resembled the HD group on additional indices of verbal learning and memory, and differed from the DEP-N group, which strongly resembled the normal control group. DEP-N patients also performed significantly better than DEP-HD patients on a number of other neuropsychological tests (e.g., WAIS-R Digit Symbol, category fluency, Trail Making Test Part B). The findings provide support for the subcortical dysfunction hypothesis, but only for a subgroup of depressed patients. Implications for differentiating depressive “pseudodementia” from AD are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies examining the way in which cognitive impairment is associated with depression have produced inconsistent findings. Different severity of depressed mood across studies may account for such conflicting reports. However, inconsistent results have also been reported in relation to the specific association of depression severity with cognitive performance. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between severity of depression and cognitive function, using the correlation (Pearson's r) between depression severity scores and neuropsychological test performance. Individual meta-analyses were conducted for composite measures of cognitive functional domains (episodic memory, executive function, processing speed, semantic memory, and visuo-spatial memory). Analyses were also done across functional domains for timed and un-timed tests. Results: Significant correlations between depression severity and cognitive performance were found in the domains of episodic memory, executive function, and processing speed, but not for semantic memory or visuo-spatial memory. For both timed and un-timed cognitive measures there were equally significant correlations with depression severity. Limitations: There were few studies meeting inclusion criteria in some cognitive domains, papers had to be excluded due to insufficient data reporting, and there are limitations associated with the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: The results suggest that previous inconsistent findings of the relationship between the severity of depression and cognitive function may be attributed to random variations and lack of power within studies.},

  abstract = {Background                                There is growing interest in glutamatergic agents in depression, particularly ketamine, a glutamate                 N                 -methyl-                 d                 -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We aimed to assess the efficacy of ketamine in major depressive episodes.                                                        Method               We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Medline from 1962 to January 2014 to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials with allocation concealment evaluating ketamine in major depressive episodes. Clinical remission, response and depressive symptoms were extracted by two independent raters. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at 24~h, 3 days and 7 days post-treatment. Analyses employed a random-effects model.                                         Results                                Data were synthesized from seven RCTs employing an intravenous infusion and one RCT employing intranasal ketamine, representing 73 subjects in parallel arms and 110 subjects in cross-over designs [                 n                 ~=~34 with bipolar disorder (BD),                 n                 ~=~149 with major depressive disorder (MDD)]. Ketamine was associated with higher rates of clinical remission relative to comparator (saline or midazolam) at 24~h [OR 7.06, number needed to treat (NNT)~=~5], 3 days (OR 3.86, NNT~=~6), and 7 days (OR 4.00, NNT~=~6), as well as higher rates of clinical response at 24~h (OR 9.10, NNT~=~3), 3 days (OR 6.77, NNT~=~3), and 7 days (OR 4.87, NNT~=~4). A standardized mean difference of 0.90 in favor of ketamine was observed at 24~h based on depression rating scale scores, with group comparisons revealing greater efficacy in unipolar depression compared to bipolar depression (1.07                 v.                 0.68). Ketamine was associated with transient psychotomimetic effects, but no persistent psychosis or affective switches.                                                        Conclusion               Our meta-analysis suggests that single administrations ketamine are efficacious in the rapid treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression. Additional research is required to determine optimal dosing schedules, route, treatment schedules, and the potential efficacy of other glutamatergic agents.},

  abstract = {Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective tools in the psychiatric treatment armamentarium, particularly for refractory depression. Yet, there remains a subset of patients who do not respond to ECT or for whom clinically adequate seizures cannot be elicited, for whom ketamine has emerged as a putative augmentation agent. Methods: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and MEDLINE from 1962 to April 2014 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating ketamine in ECT (PROSPERO \#CRD42014009035). Clinical remission, response, and change in depressive symptom scores were extracted by two independent raters. Adverse events were recorded. Drop-outs were assessed as a proxy for acceptability. Metaanalyses employed a random effects model. Results: Data were synthesized from 5 RCTs, representing a total of 182 patients with major depressive episodes (n ¼ 165 Major Depressive Disorder, n ¼ 17 Bipolar Disorder). ECT with ketamine augmentation was not associated with higher rates of clinical remission (Risk Difference (RD) ¼ 0.00; 95\%CI ¼ À0.08 to 0.10), response (RD ¼ À0.01; 95\%CI ¼ À0.11 to 0.08), or improvements in depressive symptoms (SMD ¼ 0.38; 95\%CI ¼ À0.41 to 1.17). Ketamine augmentation was associated with higher rates of confusion/ disorientation/prolonged delirium (OR ¼ 6.59, 95\%CI: 1.28e33.82, NNH ¼ 3), but not agitation, hypertension or affective switches. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of ketamine augmentation in the ECT setting suggests a lack of clinical efficacy, and an increased likelihood of confusion. Individuals for whom adequate seizures or therapeutic response cannot be obtained have not been studied using randomized controlled designs. Additional research is required to address the role of ketamine in this population.},

This cross-sectional study recruited volunteers from four elementary schools in the town of Simões Filho, Brazil. We evaluated 225 school-aged children (7–12 years) for blood lead (PbB) and manganese hair (MnH) and toenails (MnTn) by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Child and maternal IQs were estimated using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale for Intelligence (WASI). Median and range PbB were 1.2 (0.3–15.6) µg/dL. MnH and MnTn medians (ranges) were 0.74 (0.16–8.79) µg/g and 0.85 (0.15–13.30) µg/g, respectively. After adjusting for maternal IQ, age and Mn exposure, child IQ drops by 8.6 points for a 10-fold increase in PbB levels. Moreover, an effect modification of Mn co-exposure was observed. In children with low MnTn, association between Pb and child IQ was not significant (β = −6.780, p = 0.172). However, in those with high MnTn, the association was increased by 27.9\% (β = −8.70, p = 0.036). Low Pb exposure is associated with intellectual deficit in children, especially in those with high MnTn.},

  abstract = {Ketamine improves motivation-related symptoms in depression but simultaneously elicits similar symptoms in healthy individuals, suggesting that it might have different effects in health and disease. This study examined whether ketamine affects the brain’s fronto-striatal system, which is known to drive motivational behavior. The study also assessed whether inflammatory mechanisms—which are known to influence neural and behavioral motivational processes—might underlie some of these changes. These questions were explored in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ketamine in 33 individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and 25 healthy volunteers (HVs). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) was acquired 2 days post-ketamine (final sample: TRD n = 27, HV n = 19) and post-placebo (final sample: TRD n = 25, HV n = 18) infusions and was used to probe fronto-striatal circuitry with striatal seed-based functional connectivity. Ketamine increased fronto-striatal functional connectivity in TRD participants toward levels observed in HVs while shifting the connectivity profile in HVs toward a state similar to TRD participants under placebo. Preliminary findings suggest that these effects were largely observed in the absence of inflammatory (C-reactive protein) changes and were associated with both acute and sustained improvements in symptoms in the TRD group. Ketamine thus normalized fronto-striatal connectivity in TRD participants but disrupted it in HVs independently of inflammatory processes. These findings highlight the potential importance of reward circuitry in ketamine’s mechanism of action, which may be particularly relevant for understanding ketamine-induced shifts in motivational symptoms.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has medical indications but is also used as a recreational drug. Previous research has found persisting cognitive and psychotogenic effects of ketamine in chronic abusers of this drug 3 days after an acute dose. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of ketamine on two processes related to drug abuse, response inhibition and reinforcement, and to examine whether an acute dose of ketamine produced residual cognitive effects in healthy volunteers. Methods: Fifty-four healthy volunteers were given an 80-min infusion of one of two doses (0.4, 0.8 mg kg1) of ketamine or placebo. Subjects completed a battery of tests at three time points: pre-infusion, during the infusion and 3 days later at follow-up. The battery consisted of tests of episodic and semantic memory, schizophrenic-like and dissociative symptoms, response inhibition and measures of subjective effects, including mood, bodily symptoms and enjoyment of and desire for the drug. Results: Ketamine acutely impaired response inhibition and had related biphasic effects on the subjective reinforcing effects of the drug. Ketamine also acutely impaired episodic but not semantic memory and increased schizophrenic-like and dissociative symptoms. No residual cognitive effects were observed 3 days following an acute dose. Conclusions: The lack of residual effects in healthy volunteers on day 3 indicates that impairments found on day 3 in ketamine abusers are chronic effects. The abuse of ketamine may be related to its capacity both to reinforce and to decrease response inhibition.},

  abstract = {Aims Ketamine remains an important medicine in both specialist anaesthesia and aspects of pain management. At the same time, its use as a recreational drug has spread in many parts of the world during the past few years. There are now increasing concerns about the harmful physical and psychological consequences of repeated misuse of this drug. The aim of this review was to survey and integrate the research literature on physical, psychological and social harms of both acute and chronic ketamine use. Method The literature on ketamine was systematically searched and findings were classified into the matrix of Nutt et al.’s (2007) rational scale for assessing the harms of psychoactive substances. Results A major physical harm is ketamine induced ulcerative cystitis which, although its aetiology is unclear, seems particularly associated with chronic, frequent use of the drug. Frequent, daily use is also associated with neurocognitive impairment and, most robustly, deficits in working and episodic memory. Recent studies suggest certain neurological abnormalities which may underpin these cognitive effects. Many frequent users are concerned about addiction and report trying but failing to stop using ketamine. Conclusions The implications of these findings are drawn out for treatment of ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis in which interventions from urologists and from addiction specialists should be coordinated. Neurocognitive impairment in frequent users can impact negatively upon achievement in education and at work, and also compound addiction problems. Prevention and harm minimization campaigns are needed to alert young people to these harmful and potentially chronic effects of ketamine.},

  abstract = {Objective To follow-up a population of ketamine users tested 3 years previously and examine whether impairments observed 3 days after drug use are enduring or reversible. Methods Eighteen ketamine users and 10 polydrug controls from studies conducted between 3 and 4 years earlier were re-tested on the same battery of cognitive tasks and subjective measures. These tapped episodic, semantic and working memory and executive and attentional functioning. Subjective schizotypal, dissociative, mood and bodily symptoms were also examined and a drug use history recorded. Results The ketamine users had reduced their frequency of use of ketamine by an average of 88.3\%. Performance of ketamine users on tasks tapping semantic memory had improved and this improvement was correlated with their reduction in ketamine use. On tasks tapping episodic memory and attentional functioning, ketamine users still showed deficits compared to polydrug controls. Higher levels of schizotypal symptoms and perceptual distortions were exhibited by the ketamine group, although dissociative symptoms were similar to controls. Conclusions These findings indicate that semantic memory impairments associated with recreational ketamine are reversible upon marked reduction of use; however, impairments to episodic memory and possibly attentional functioning appear long-lasting. In addition, schizotypal symptoms and perceptual distortions may persist after cessation of ketamine use. Ketamine users, or potential users, should be aware of the enduring effects of this drug on aspects of memory and subjective experience.},

Methods Twenty-four participants (19–49 years) were randomized to one of two treatment sequences in which either esketamine 84 mg or placebo was intranasally administered in a double-blind, two-period crossover design. Primary measures included five tests of Cogstate® computerized test battery assessed at 1 h predose and 40 min, 2, 4, and 6 h postdose. Secondary measures included the Mental Effort Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and safety. Results Esketamine was associated with significant cognitive performance impairment at 40 min postdose for all five Cogstate® tests (Detection p = 0.0011, Identification p = 0.0006, One-Card Learning p = 0.0040, One Back p = 0.0017, and Groton Maze Learning Test p {$<$} 0.0001) versus placebo. In contrast, performance on these tests did not differ significantly between esketamine and placebo at 2, 4, or 6 h postdose. Secondary outcomes indicated a significant, transient increase from baseline under esketamine versus placebo at 40 min postdose on the Mental Effort Scale and at 40 min and 2 h postdose on KSS (p {$<$} 0.0001 for both); however, no significant difference was observed on these outcomes between esketamine and placebo at later timepoints. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness (67\%), nausea (37.5\%), disturbance in attention (29.2\%), and fatigue (29.2\%); the majority were considered mild in severity. Conclusions Esketamine was associated with cognitive performance decline, and greater effort was required to complete the test battery versus placebo at 40 min postdose, which returned to placebo-comparable levels by 2 h postdose.

  abstract = {Background. Depression is associated with alterations of emotional and cognitive processing, and executive control in particular. Previous research has shown that depressed patients are impaired in their ability to shift attention from one emotional category to another, but whether this shifting deficit is more evident on emotional relative to non-emotional cognitive control tasks remains unclear. Method. The performance of patients with major depressive disorder and matched healthy control participants was compared on neutral and emotional variants of a dynamic cognitive control task that requires participants to shift attention and response from one category to another. Results. Relative to controls, depressed patients were impaired on both tasks, particularly in terms of performance accuracy. In the neutral go/no-go task, the ability of depressed patients to flexibly shift attention and response from one class of neutral stimuli to the other was unimpaired. This contrasted with findings for the emotional go/no-go task, where responding was slower specifically on blocks of trials that required participants to shift attention and response from one emotional category to the other. Conclusions. The present data indicate that any depression-related difficulties with cognitive flexibility and control may be particularly evident on matched tasks that require processing of relevant emotional, rather than simply neutral, stimuli. The implications of these findings for our developing understanding of cognitive and emotional control processes in depression are discussed.},

Therefore, the aims of the current study were to characterize the relationship between baseline neurocognition and antidepressant response to ketamine, measure the acute impact of ketamine on neurocognition, and investigate the relationship between acute neurocognitive effects of ketamine and antidepressant response. Methods Neurocognitive functioning was assessed in 25 patients with TRD using a comprehensive battery: estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), current IQ, and tests from the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). A subset of the MCCB was repeated immediately following a 40-min intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Results Patients who responded to ketamine 24 h following treatment had poorer baseline neurocognitive performance relative to nonresponders and, in particular, slower processing speed (F =8.42; df =23; p =0.008). Ketamine was associated with selective impairments in memory recall, and the degree of cognitive change carried negative prognostic significance (e.g., negative cognitive effects immediately after ketamine predicted lower response rate at 24 h; Fisher's exact test twosided p =0.027). Conclusions Taken together, our findings suggest a potential baseline neurocognitive predictor of ketamine response and an inverse relationship between the cognitive effects of ketamine and antidepressant efficacy.},

N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptor inhibition may alleviate such stress-induced dendritic reorganization in the mPFC. However, it is unknown whether administration of a NMDAR antagonist would also prevent alterations in PFC-mediated cognitive functions. Here, we investigated whether administration of ketamine, the noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors before each stress session would prevent cognitive impairments in a rat model of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent attentional set-shifting task (ASST), a measure of cognitive flexibility. Repeated restraint stress (1 h daily for 7 days) significantly and specifically impaired extra-dimensional (ED) set-shifting ability of rats. Pretreatment with ketamine (10 mg/ kg, IP) completely and specifically prevented this stress-induced cognitive inflexibility. The present study demonstrates procognitive efficacy of ketamine in an animal stress model, which confirms and extends the role of the NMDA receptors in mediating stress-evoked prefrontal dysfunctions.},

  abstract = {Background: Psychotic depression (PD) is classified as a subtype of severe depression in the current diagnostic manuals. Accordingly, it is a common conception among psychiatrists that psychotic features in depression arise as a consequence of depressive severity. The aim of this study was to determine whether the severity of depressive and psychotic symptoms correlate in accordance with this “severity–psychosis” hypothesis and to detect potential differences in the clinical features of PD and non-psychotic depression (non-PD). Methods: Quantitative analysis of Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) scores from all patients admitted to a Danish general psychiatric hospital due to a severe depressive episode in the period between 2000 and 2010 was performed. Results: A total of 357 patients with severe depression, of which 125 (35\%) were of the psychotic subtype, formed the study sample. Mean HoNOS scores at admission differed significantly between patients with non-PD and PD on the items hallucinations and delusions (nonPD = 0.33 vs. PD = 1.37, p b 0.001), aggression (non-PD = 0.20 vs. PD = 0.36, p = 0.044) and on the total score (non-PD = 10.55 vs. PD = 11.87, p = 0.024). The HoNOS scores on the two items “depression” and “hallucinations and delusions” were very weakly correlated. Limitations: Diagnoses were based on normal clinical practice and not formalized research criteria. Conclusions: The symptomatology of PD and non-PD differs beyond the mere psychosis. Furthermore, severity ratings of depressive and psychotic symptoms are very weakly correlated. These findings offer further support to the hypothesis stating that the psychotic- and nonpsychotic subtypes of depression may in fact be distinct clinical syndromes.},

  abstract = {Background: The Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS) has been validated as a method of assessing the severity and treatment outcomes of psychotic depression (PD). We aimed to compare the results of the PDAS in PD and non-psychotic depression (non-PD) patients and validate the PDAS as a diagnostic tool for PD. Methods: We included 53 patients with PD and 441 with non-PD who participated in the Clinical Research Center for Depression study in South Korea. In addition to the PDAS, psychometric tools including the HAMD17, HAMA, BPRS, CGI-S, SOFAS, SSI-Beck, WHOQOL-BREF, AUDIT, and FTND were used to assess, respectively, depression, anxiety, overall symptoms, global severity, social functioning, suicidal ideation, quality of life, alcohol use, and nicotine use. Results: After adjusting for age and total HAMD17 score, PD patients had higher scores for depressive mood, hallucinations, unusual thought content, suspiciousness, blunted affect, and emotional withdrawal on the PDAS and higher total scores on the SSI-Beck than non-PD patients. Binary logistic regression identified hallucinatory behavior and emotional withdrawal as predictors of PD. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that emotional withdrawal could be used to differentiate psychotic from non-psychotic depression. Limitations: The inter-rater reliability for psychometric assessments was not evaluated. Conclusions: In addition to assessing the severity and treatment outcomes of PD, PDAS can help in the diagnosis of PD.},

  abstract = {Deficits in cognitive flexibility are prominent in stress-related psychiatric disorders, including depression. Ketamine has rapid antidepressant efficacy, but it is unknown if ketamine improves cognitive symptoms. In rats, 2 weeks chronic intermittent cold (CIC) stress impairs reversal learning, a form of cognitive flexibility mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that we have used previously to model cognitive dysfunction in depression. We have shown that activating JAK2/STAT3 signaling in the OFC rescued the CIC stress-induced reversal learning deficit. Thus, in the present study we determined if ketamine also corrects the stress-induced reversal learning deficit, and if JAK2/STAT3 signaling is involved in this effect. A single injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), 24h prior to testing rescued the CIC stress-induced reversal learning deficit. CIC stress decreased JAK2 phosphorylation in the OFC, and ketamine restored pJAK2 levels within 2hr post-injection. The JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, given systemically or into the OFC at the time of ketamine injection prevented its beneficial effect on reversal learning. We then tested the role of JAK2/STAT3 in ketamine-induced plasticity in the OFC. Ketamine depressed local field potentials evoked in the OFC by excitatory thalamic afferent stimulation, and this was prevented by JAK2 inhibition in the OFC. Further, in both the OFC and primary cortical neurons in culture, ketamine increased expression of the neural plasticity-related protein, Arc, and this was prevented by JAK2 inhibition. These results suggest that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is a novel mechanism by which ketamine exerts its therapeutic effects on stress-induced cognitive dysfunction in the OFC.},

  abstract = {Background: Ketamine is increasingly used in pain therapy but may impair brain functions. Mood and cognitive capacities were compared after equianalgesic small-dose S(؉)-, R(؊)-, and racemic ketamine in healthy volunteers. Methods: Twenty-four subjects received intravenous 0.5 mg/kg racemic, 0.25 mg/kg S(؉)-, and 1.0 mg/kg R(؊)-ketamine in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Hemodynamic variables, mood, and cognitive capacities were assessed for 60 min. Results: Transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and catecholamines were similar after administration of all drugs. At 20 min after injection, subjects felt less decline in concentration and were more brave after S(؉)- than racemic ketamine. They reported being less lethargic but more out-of-control after R(؊)- than racemic ketamine. Ketamine isomers induced less drowsiness, less lethargy, and less impairment in clustered subjective cognitive capacity than racemic ketamine for the 60-min study. Objective concentration capacity [test time, S(؉): 25.4 ؎ 15.2 s, R(؊): 34.8 ؎ 18.4 s, racemic ketamine: 40.8 ؎ 20.8 s, mean ؎ SD] and retention in primary memory [test time, S(؉): 4.6 ؎ 1.2 s, R(؊): 4.2 ؎ 1.4 s, racemic ketamine: 4.0 ؎ 1.4 s, mean ؎ SD] declined less after S(؉)- than either R(؊)- or racemic ketamine at 1 min. At 5 min, immediate recall, anterograde amnesia, retention in primary memory, short-term storage capacity, and intelligence quotient were less reduced after the isomers than racemic ketamine. Speed reading and central information flow decreased less after S(؉)- than racemic ketamine. Conclusions: Early after injection, ketamine isomers induce less tiredness and cognitive impairment than equianalgesic small-dose racemic ketamine. In addition, S(؉)-ketamine causes less decline in concentration capacity and primary memory. The differences in drug effects cannot be explained by stereoselective action on one given receptor.},

  abstract = {A single subanesthetic dose of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, leads to fast-acting antidepressant effects. In rodent models, systemic ketamine is associated with higher dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex, reflecting structural remodeling that may underlie the behavioral changes. However, turnover of dendritic spines is a dynamic process in vivo, and the longitudinal effects of ketamine on structural plasticity remain unclear. The purpose of the current study is to use subcellular resolution optical imaging to determine the time course of dendritic alterations in vivo following systemic ketamine administration in mice. We used two-photon microscopy to visualize repeatedly the same set of dendritic branches in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC) before and after a single injection of ketamine or saline. Compared to controls, ketamine-injected mice had higher dendritic spine density in MFC for up to 2 weeks. This prolonged increase in spine density was driven by an elevated spine formation rate, and not by changes in the spine elimination rate. A fraction of the new spines following ketamine injection was persistent, which is indicative of functional synapses. In a few cases, we also observed retraction of distal apical tuft branches on the day immediately after ketamine administration. These results indicate that following systemic ketamine administration, certain dendritic inputs in MFC are removed immediately, while others are added gradually. These dynamic structural modifications are consistent with a model of ketamine action in which the net effect is a rebalancing of synaptic inputs received by frontal cortical neurons.},

  abstract = {Although (S)-ketamine was approved for use in treatment-resistant depression in 2019, new preclinical findings suggest that (R)-ketamine might produce better efficacy and tolerability relative to (S)-ketamine. Here we evaluated the effects of (R)-, (S)-, and (R,S)-ketamine on executive functions as measured in the attentional set shifting task (ASST) and on their discriminative stimulus effects in rats. Earlier data demonstrated that cognitive flexibility is compromised by (R,S)-ketamine, but the effects of enantiomers in rats are unknown. Separate cohorts of rats were tested in ASST and trained to discriminate either (R,S)-ketamine, (S)-ketamine, or (R)ketamine (all at 10 mg/kg) from saline; in order to maintain the discrimination, a higher (R)-ketamine dose (17.5 mg/kg) was subsequently instituted. In ASST, all three forms increased the trials to criterion measure at reversal learning and extra-dimensional set-shifting phases. However, in contrast to (R)- and (S)-ketamine, (R,S)-ketamine prolonged the mean time to complete a single trial during early stages, suggesting increased reaction time, and/or unspecific side-effects related to motor or motivational impairments. In the drug discriminations, all rats acquired their respective discriminations between drug and saline. In (R,S)-ketamine-trained rats, (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine only partially substituted for the training dose of (R,S)-ketamine. Further, (R)-ketamine did not fully substitute in rats trained to (S)-ketamine. The data suggest more serious cognitive deficits produced by (R,S)-ketamine than its enantiomers. Furthermore, (R,S)-ketamine and its isomers share overlapping but not isomorphic discriminative stimulus effects predicting distinct subjective responses to (R)- vs. (S)-ketamine in humans.},

Results revealed that overall, antidepressants have a modest, positive effect on divided attention, executive function, immediate memory, processing speed, recent memory and sustained attention for depressed participants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) were found to have the greatest positive effect on cognition for depressed participants, as compared to the other classes of antidepressants analysed.

The current review presents a novel integrative model of neuroplasticity as a multi-domain neurobiological, cognitive, and psychological construct relevant in depression and other related disorders of negative affect (e.g., anxiety). We delineate a working conceptual model in which synaptic plasticity deficits described in animal models are integrated and conceptually linked with human patient findings from cognitive science and clinical psychology. We review relevant reports including neuroimaging findings (e.g., decreased functional connectivity in prefrontal-limbic circuits), cognitive deficits (e.g., executive function and memory impairments), affective information processing patterns (e.g., rigid, negative biases in attention, memory, interpretations, and self-associations), and patient-reported symptoms (perseverative, inflexible thought patterns; inflexible and maladaptive behaviors). Finally, we incorporate discussion of integrative research methods capable of building additional direct empirical support, including using rapid-acting treatments (e.g., ketamine) as a means to test this integrative model by attempting to simultaneously reverse these deficits across levels of analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the search for novel treatments for depression, ketamine has emerged as a unique agent with rapid antidepressant effects. Experimental tasks involving emotional processing can be used during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to investigate ketamine’s effects on brain function in major depressive disorder (MDD). This study examined ketamine’s effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during an emotional processing task. METHODS: A total of 33 individuals with treatment-resistant MDD and 24 healthy control participants (HCs) took part in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants received ketamine and placebo infusions 2 weeks apart, and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were conducted at baseline and 2 days after each infusion. Blood oxygen level–dependent signal was measured during an emotional processing task, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze differences in activation among group, drug, and task-specific factors. RESULTS: A group-by-drug interaction was observed in several brain regions, including a right frontal cluster extending into the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Participants with MDD had greater activity than HCs after placebo infusion but showed lower activity after ketamine infusion, which was similar to the activity in HCs after placebo. A group-by-drug-by-task condition interaction was also found, which showed further differences that varied between implicit and explicit emotional conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The main results indicate that ketamine had differential effects on brain activity in participants with MDD versus HCs. The pattern of activation in participants with MDD after ketamine infusion resembled the activation in HCs after placebo infusion, suggesting a normalization of function during emotional processing. The findings contribute to a better understanding of ketamine’s actions in the brain.},

  abstract = {Background. Cognitive performance is often impaired in depression, and these impairments can persist even after remission from psychopathological symptoms. However, it is still unclear whether cognitive dysfunction is associated with psychopathological symptoms or represents a genuine disorder. This study examined cognitive performance in acute depression, after remission, and 6 months after remission in order to determine the nature and specificity of cognitive dysfunction as well as its relevance for the further course of depression. Method. Assessments of cognitive function and psychopathology were carried out on admission and prior to discharge in 53 in-patients with unipolar depression. Twenty patients were retested 6 months after discharge. To correct for practice effects, 13 healthy subjects were included and assessed twice with the same cognitive tests. Results. In acute depression, we found impairments of information processing/attention, memory, and executive functions. Cognitive impairments remained in a high proportion of patients, even after remission of psychopathological symptoms. After correcting for practice effects, a significant improvement was observed only for some tests of executive functioning. Severity of depression was only weakly correlated with one single cognitive measure, indicating that psychopathological and neuropsychological symptoms are dissociable. Furthermore, we found no evidence for specific cognitive dysfunction. Conclusions. Our results support the hypothesis that cognitive impairments in depression are neither selective nor specific ; they have trait-like features and are, therefore, not merely an epiphenomenon of depression. Whether or not cognitive dysfunction is a prognostic marker for the course of depression remains still an open issue.},

  abstract = {Background. This review aimed to address the question of whether cognitive impairment should be considered a core feature of depression that may be a valuable target for treatment. Method. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive function, assessed with a single neuropsychological test battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with depression during symptomatic and remitted states. Inclusion of studies comparing patients remitted from depression and controls enabled us to investigate whether cognitive impairment persists beyond episodes of low mood in depression. Results. Our meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory and attention in patients with depression relative to controls (Cohen’s d effect sizes ranging from −0.34 to −0.65). Significant moderate deficits in executive function and attention (Cohen’s d ranging from −0.52 to −0.61) and non-significant small/moderate deficits in memory (Cohen’s d ranging from −0.22 to −0.54) were found to persist in patients whose depressive symptoms had remitted, indicating that cognitive impairment occurs separately from episodes of low mood in depression. Conclusions. Both low mood and cognitive impairment are associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Therefore, we argue that remediation of cognitive impairment and alleviation of depressive symptoms each play an important role in improving outcome for patients with depression. In conclusion, this systematic review and metaanalysis demonstrates that cognitive impairment represents a core feature of depression that cannot be considered an epiphenomenon that is entirely secondary to symptoms of low mood and that may be a valuable target for future interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies with children exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) through fish consumption in the Brazilian Amazon region report that the high levels of hair Hg are associated with significant decreases in intelligence, memory, attention, and visuospatial processing. Objective: To investigate the relationship between mercury exposure and neuropsychological functions in riverside communities of the Brazilian Amazon. Method: 263 participants aged 6 to 14 years old were assessed, from resettlement regions, near the Madeira river, Rondônia, Brazil. To assess the neuropsychological functions we used the following instruments: intelligence (WASI), working memory (Corsi Block-Tapping Task and Digit Span), verbal fluency (Word Generation - NEPSY II), inhibitory control (Inhibition Errors - NEPSY II), shifting (Trail Making Test) and manual motor dexterity (Grooved PegBoard Test). Socioeconomic status was obtained through household surveys. Total Hg levels were quantified hair samples (Total HgH) collected from the occipital region of the scalp and analyzed by Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Results: The group in the upper quartile of Total HgH levels presented lower scores on the tasks that assessed estimated IQ, visuospatial working memory, semantic knowledge and phonological verbal fluency, when compared to the group in the lower quartile level. A regression analysis controlled for age, sex, and maternal education showed that for each increase of 10 μg/g of Total HgH, there was a decrease around half standard deviation in Verbal IQ, estimated IQ scores, semantic knowledge, phonological verbal fluency and for verbal and visuospatial working memory. Conclusions: High concentrations of Total Hg in hair were associated with a lower performance in neuropsychological functions tests. The results show that environmental exposure to Hg is associated to children and adolescents’ lower neuropsychological performance in the riverine and resettled areas of the Brazilian Amazon region.},

  abstract = {Background: Ketamine demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, evaluation of ketamine's neurocognitive effect in TRD is unclear. We aim to (1) characterize baseline neurocognitive performance as a predictor of the change in severity of depressive symptoms over time, and (2) investigate the association of six versus single intravenous (IV) ketamine and neurocognitive changes from baseline to the end of treatment. Methods: Subjects with TRD were randomized to receive either five IV midazolam followed by a single IV ketamine or six IV ketamine during a 12-day period. Depression symptom assessments occurred prior and 24 h after infusion days using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Neurocognitive tasks were designed to test attention, memory, speed of processing, and set shifting using the CogState battery at baseline and at the end of treatment. Results: Better complex working memory at baseline predicted improvement in MADRS scores of ketamine (vs midazolam) after 5 infusions. Most, but not all, neurocognitive functions remained stable or improved after repeated or single ketamine. There was a greater differential effect of treatment on speed of processing, set shifting, and spatial working memory that favors subjects in the six ketamine group. These cognitive improvements from baseline to the end of treatment were robust when controlling for age and changes in depression severity. Conclusion: The study suggests that six IV ketamine compared to single IV ketamine has a mood independent procognitive effect among TRD patients. Large scale studies are needed to confirm whether ketamine enhances cognitive function in TRD.},

  abstract = {The N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, evaluation of ketamine’s neurocognitive aspects in TRD has started to be explored. This study aims to (1) examine baseline neurocognitive performance and change in severity of depressive symptoms through six ketamine infusions, (2) examine the neurocognitive effects after completion of serial infusions and whether changes were associated to relapse to depression. Six IV infusions of 0.5 mg/Kg ketamine over 40 min were conducted on a Monday–Wednesday–Friday schedule during a 12-d period on 15 patients with TRD followed by a 4-wk observational period. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using the CogState battery at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Tasks were designed to test attention, memory (working, visual, and verbal), speed of processing, and set shifting. The likelihood of response through six infusions was greater among depressed subjects with lower attention at baseline (F(1,13) = 5.59, p = 0.034). Significant improvement was found in scores of visual memory (F(4,33.82) = 5.12, p = 0.002), simple working memory (F(4, 24.85) = 3.29, p = 0.027) and complex working memory (F(4, 32.76) = 4.18, p = 0.008) after the last ketamine infusion. However, neurocognitive changes were accounted for by improvement in the severity of depressive symptom. The acute neurocognitive effect after completion of repeated infusions was not associated with the likelihood of subsequent relapse during follow-up. Our findings suggest a potential baseline neurocognitive predictor of ketamine response and the apparently lack of short-term neurocognitive impairment after completion of six ketamine infusions in TRD.},

This study aimed to identify functional changes within neural networks that may underlie the impact of ketamine on both reward and emotional processing in patients with treatment-resistant major depression.                                         Methods               Ten adult patients with a Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score above 25 were enrolled to receive a single intravenous administration of ketamine (0.5\,mg/kg). Patients’ performance along with related neural network activations were analyzed in a game-like reward task and in an emotional judgment task using functional magnetic resonance imaging 1 day before and 1 and 7 days after ketamine administration.                                         Results               A significant correlation (R2 = 0.46, P = 0.03) between the improvement of depression scores and the enhanced reaction time for positive items was found in the game-like reward task 1 day after ketamine administration. This enhanced sensitivity for rewarded items was accompanied by increased activity of reward-related brain regions, including the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and the ventral tegmental area, an effect that persisted up to 1 week after ketamine injection. In the emotional judgment task, it was found that ketamine rapidly modified local brain activities in response to emotionally negative, positive, or neutral stimuli in the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and in the ventral tegmental area.                                         Conclusions               Single bolus ketamine administration rapidly triggers lasting changes in mesolimbic neural networks to improve pathologic reward and emotional processing in patients with major depressive disorder.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ketamine is increasingly being used as a therapeutic for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet the effects of ketamine on the human brain remain largely unknown. This pilot study employed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to examine relationships between ketamine treatment and white matter (WM) microstructure, with the aim of increasing the current understanding of ketamine’s neural mechanisms of action in humans. Longitudinal dMRI data were acquired from 13 individuals with TRD two hours prior to (pre-infusion), and four hours following (post-infusion), an intravenous ketamine infusion. Free-water imaging was employed to quantify cerebrospinal fluid-corrected mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 15 WM bundles pre- and post-infusion. Analyses revealed that higher pre-infusion FA in the left cingulum bundle and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with greater depression symptom improvement 24\,h post-ketamine. Moreover, four hours after intravenous administration of ketamine, FA rapidly increased in numerous WM bundles in the brain; this increase was significantly associated with 24\,h symptom improvement in select bundles. Overall, the results of this preliminary study suggest that WM properties, as measured by dMRI, may have a potential impact on clinical improvement following ketamine. Ketamine administration additionally appears to be associated with rapid WM diffusivity changes, suggestive of rapid changes in WM microstructure. This study thus points to pre-treatment WM structure as a potential factor associated with ketamine’s clinical efficacy, and to post-treatment microstructural changes as a candidate neuroimaging marker of ketamine’s cellular mechanisms.},

We previously reported that (R)-ketamine produced the beneficial effects compared to (S)-ketamine in several animal models including depression. Here we compared the effects of two enantiomers of ketamine on cognitive deficits in mice after repeated administration of PCP. PCP (10 mg/ kg/day for 10 days)-induced cognitive deficits were ameliorated by subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly for 2-weeks), but not (S)-ketamine. Western blot analysis showed decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and decreased ratio of phosphorylatedTrkB (p-TrkB) to TrkB in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of PCP-treated mice. Furthermore, PCPinduced reduction of BDNF and p-TrkB/TrkB ratio in the PFC and hippocampus of PCP-treated mice was ameliorated by subsequent intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine were blocked by pretreatment with TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. These findings suggest that (R)-ketamine could ameliorate PCP-induced cognitive deficits via activation of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the brain. Therefore, (R)-ketamine could be a potential therapeutic drug for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insu ciently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment e ects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random e ects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespeciÿcation of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientiÿc rationale for using meta-regression and the di cult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.

  abstract = {Background. Slowing of the speed of information processing has been reported in geriatric depression, but it is not clear if the impairment is present in younger patients, if motor retardation is responsible, or if antidepressant medications play a role. Method. Twenty unmedicated unipolar depressed inpatients were compared with 19 medicated depressed in-patients and 20 age-, sex- and verbal IQ-matched controls on inspection time (IT), a measure of speed of information processing that does not require a speeded motor response. We also examined the relationship between IT and current mood and length of depressive illness. Results. Unmedicated depressed patients showed slowing of information processing speed when compared to both medicated depressed patients and controls. The latter two groups were not significantly different from each other. Slowing of IT was not associated with current mood, but was negatively correlated with length of illness since first episode. No differences in IT were found between patients receiving medication with anticholinergic effects and patients receiving medication with no anticholinergic effects. Conclusions. The findings indicate that unipolar depression is associated with a slowing of speed of information processing in younger patients who have not received antidepressant medication. This does not appear to be a result of motor slowing.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (OAD) in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This phase 3, open-label, multicenter, long-term (up to 1 year) study was conducted between October 2015 and October 2017. Patients (≥\,18 years) with TRD (DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder and nonresponse to ≥\,2 OAD treatments) were enrolled directly or transferred from a shortterm study (patients aged ≥\,65 years). Esketamine nasal spray (28-mg, 56-mg, or 84-mg) plus new OAD was administered twice a week in a 4-week induction (IND) phase and weekly or every-other-week for patients who were responders and entered a 48-week optimization/maintenance (OP/MAINT) phase. Results: Of 802 enrolled patients, 86.2\% were direct-entry and 13.8\% were transferred-entry; 580 (74.5\%) of 779 patients who entered the IND phase completed the phase, and 150 (24.9\%) of 603 who entered the OP/MAINT phase completed the phase. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were dizziness (32.9\%), dissociation (27.6\%), nausea (25.1\%), and headache (24.9\%). Seventy-six patients (9.5\%) discontinued esketamine due to TEAEs. Fifty-five patients (6.9\%) experienced serious TEAEs. Most TEAEs occurred on dosing days, were mild or moderate in severity, and resolved on the same day. Two deaths were reported; neither was considered related to esketamine. Cognitive performance generally either improved or remained stable postbaseline. There was no case of interstitial cystitis or respiratory depression. Treatment-emergent dissociative symptoms were transient and generally resolved within 1.5 hours postdose. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score decreased during the IND phase, and this reduction persisted during the OP/MAINT phase (mean [SD] change from baseline of respective phase to endpoint: IND, −16.4 [8.76]; OP/MAINT, 0.3 [8.12]). Conclusions: Long-term esketamine nasal spray plus new OAD therapy had a manageable safety profile, and improvements in depression appeared to be sustained in patients with TRD.},

  abstract = {Background: Major depression is associated with cognitive deficits, particularly those requiring central executive functioning. Depressed patients also tend to focus on and think about their symptoms and problems (“ruminate”) more than non-depressed controls. Although an association has been found between rumination and impaired performance on a central executive processing task, the causal relation between impaired executive functioning and rumination has not been determined. This study sought to directly manipulate rumination and assess the impact on executive functioning in depression as measured by random number generation. Methods: Depressed patients (n=14) and non-depressed controls (n=14) were compared on a random number generation task, performed after both a rumination induction and after a distraction induction, with order of inductions counter balanced within each group. Results: Compared with the distraction induction, the rumination induction produced a significant increase in both ruminations and the tendency towards stereotyped counting responses (thought to reflect a failure of inhibitory executive control) in depressed patients but not in controls. However, after distraction, no difference in random number generation or rumination was found between the two groups. Conclusions: The aspects of executive function involved in random number generation are not fundamentally impaired in depressed patients. In depressed patients, the rumination induction seems to trigger the continued generation of ruminative stimulus independent thoughts, which interferes with concurrent executive processing.},

  abstract = {The robust antidepressant effects of (R,S)-ketamine are among the most important discoveries in mood research over the last half century. Off-label use of (R,S)-ketamine, which is an equal mixture of (R)-ketamine and (S)ketamine, has become especially popular in the United States (US) for treatment-resistant depression. On March 5, 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an (S)-ketamine nasal spray for use in treatmentresistant depression, though its use has been limited to certified medical offices or clinics. On December 19, 2019, (S)-ketamine nasal spray was approved for the same indication in Europe. However, despite its potential for benefit, there are several concerns about the efficacy of (S)-ketamine nasal spray. Accumulating evidence from preclinical studies show that (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression, and that (R)-ketamine has fewer detrimental side effects than either (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine. As such, clinical studies of (R)-ketamine in humans are now underway by Perception Neuroscience Ltd. In this article, we review the brief history of (R,S)-ketamine and its two enantiomers as novel antidepressants. We also discuss the mechanisms of ketamine's antidepressant actions.},

  abstract = {The discovery of robust antidepressant actions exerted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (R,S)ketamine has been a crucial breakthrough in mood disorder research. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson \& Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDARrelated compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain–gut–microbiota axis and brain–spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson’s disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.},

  abstract = {Introduction—Ketamine has shown rapid though short-lived antidepressant effects. The possibility of concerning neurobiological changes following repeated exposure to the drug motivate the development of strategies that obviate or minimize the need for longer-term treatment with ketamine. In this open-label trial, we investigated whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can sustain or extend ketamine's antidepressant effects. Methods—Patients who were pursuing ketamine infusion therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were invited to participate in the study. If enrolled, the subjects initiated a 12session, 10-week course of CBT concurrently with a short 4-treatment, 2-week course of intravenous ketamine (0.5mg/kg infused over 40 mins) provided under a standardized clinical protocol. Results—Sixteen participants initiated the protocol, with 8 (50\%) attaining a response to the ketamine and 7 (43.8\%) achieving remission during the first two weeks of protocol. Among ketamine responders, the relapse rate at the end of the CBT course (8 weeks following the last ketamine exposure) was 25\% (2/8). On longer-term follow up, 5 of 8 subjects eventually relapsed, the median time-to-relapse being 12 weeks following ketamine exposure. Among ketamine remitters, 3 of 7 retained remission until at least 4 weeks following the last ketamine exposure, with 2 retaining remission through 8 weeks following ketamine exposure. Ketamine nonresponders did not appear to benefit from CBT. Conclusions—CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD. Well-powered randomized controlled trials are warranted to further investigate this treatment combination as a way to sustain ketamine's antidepressant effects.},

  abstract = {We shed much needed light upon a critical assumption that is oft-overlooked---or not considered at all---in random-effects meta-analysis.Namely, that between-study variance is constant across \textbackslash emph\{all\} studies which implies they are from the \textbackslash emph\{same\} population.  Yet it is not hard to imagine a situation where there are several and not merely one population of studies, perhaps differing in their between-study variance (i.e., heteroskedasticity).  The objective is to then make inference, given that there are variations in heterogeneity. There is an immediate problem, however, in that modeling heterogeneous variance components is not straightforward to do in a general way. To this end, we propose novel methodology, termed Bayesian location-scale meta-analysis, that can accommodate moderators for both the overall effect (location) and the between-study variance (scale). After introducing the model, we then extend heterogeneity statistics, prediction intervals, and hierarchical shrinkage, all of which customarily assume constant heterogeneity, to include variations therein. With these new tools in hand, we go to work demonstrating  that quite literally \textbackslash emph\{everything\} changes when between-study variance is not constant across studies. The changes were not small and easily passed the interocular trauma test---the importance hits right between the eyes. Such examples include (but are not limited to) inference on the overall effect, a compromised predictive distribution, and improper shrinkage of the study-specific effects. Further, we provide an illustrative example where heterogeneity was not considered a mere nuisance to show that modeling variance for its own sake can provide unique inferences, in this case into discrimination across nine countries. The discussion includes several ideas for future research. We have implemented the proposed methodology in the \{\textbackslash tt R\} package \textbackslash textbf\{blsmeta\}.},

It is suggested that the central executive component of an earlier model of working memory might provide a suitable framework for such an analysis. The approach is illustrated using one proposed component of executive control, namely the capacity to combine two concurrent tasks. The application of the approach to patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, and patients with acquired brain damage is discussed. Finally, a study is described in which the dual task performance of patients with known frontal lesions is shown to be associated with observed behavioural problems. The paper concludes with the discussion of the prospects for extending the approach to include a range of other executive processes, and to the way in which such an analysis may subsequently lead to a more integrated model of the central executive, and a better understanding of its relationship to the prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Previous studies have shown that a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients and in animal models of depression. However, the underlying mechanisms are not totally understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of acute administration of different doses of ketamine on the immobility time of rats in the forced swimming test (FST) and to determine levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Methods. Forty male Wistar rats weighing 180–220 g were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 each): group saline and groups ketamine 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg. On the first day, all animals were forced to swim for 15 min. On the second day ketamine (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, respectively) was given intraperitoneally, at 30 min before the second episode of the forced swimming test. Immobility times of the rats during the forced swimming test were recorded. The animals were then decapitated. The hippocampus was harvested for determination of BDNF and mTOR levels. Results. Compared with group saline, administration of ketamine at a dose of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg decreased the duration of immobility (P {$<$} 0.05 for all doses). Ketamine at doses of both 10 and 15 mg/kg showed a significant increase in the expression of hippocampal BDNF (P {$<$} 0.05 for both doses). Ketamine given at doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg showed significant increases in relative levels of hippocampal p-mTOR (P {$<$} 0.05 for all doses) Conclusion. The antidepressant effect of ketamine might be related to the increased expression of BDNF and mTOR in the hippocampus of rats.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Although the robust antidepressant effects of the               N               -methyl-               d               -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression are beyond doubt, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects remain unknown. NMDAR inhibition and the subsequent α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation are suggested to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Although (               R               )-ketamine is a less potent NMDAR antagonist than (               S               )-ketamine, (               R               )-ketamine has shown more marked and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (               S               )-ketamine in several animal models of depression. Furthermore, non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists do not exhibit robust ketamine-like antidepressant effects in patients with depression. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than NMDAR inhibition play a key role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Duman’s group demonstrated that the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the medial prefrontal cortex is reportedly involved in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. However, we reported that mTORC1 serves a role in the antidepressant effects of (               S               )-ketamine, but not of (               R               )-ketamine, and that extracellular signal-regulated kinase possibly underlie the antidepressant effects of (               R               )-ketamine. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), are crucial in the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its two enantiomers, (               R               )-ketamine and (               S               )-ketamine, in rodents. In addition, (2               R               ,6               R               )-hydroxynormetamine [a metabolite of (               R               )-ketamine] and (               S               )-norketamine [a metabolite of (               S               )-ketamine] have been shown to exhibit antidepressant-like effects on rodents through the BDNF–TrkB cascade. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of enantiomers of ketamine and its metabolites. It may be time to reconsider the hypothesis of NMDAR inhibition and the subsequent AMPAR activation in the antidepressant effects of ketamine.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Although the efficacy of racemate ketamine, a rapid onset and sustained antidepressant, for patients with treatment-resistant depression was a serendipitous finding, clinical use of ketamine is limited, due to psychotomimetic side effects and abuse liability. Behavioral and side-effect evaluation tests were applied to compare the two stereoisomers of ketamine. To elucidate their potential therapeutic mechanisms, we examined the effects of these stereoisomers on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–TrkB signaling, and synaptogenesis in selected brain regions. In the social defeat stress and learned helplessness models of depression,               R               -ketamine showed a greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effect than               S               -ketamine (esketamine). Furthermore,               R               -ketamine induced a more potent beneficial effect on decreased dendritic spine density, BDNF–TrkB signaling and synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus from depressed mice compared with               S               -ketamine. However, neither stereoisomer affected these alterations in the nucleus accumbens of depressed mice. In behavioral tests for side effects,               S               -ketamine, but not               R               -ketamine, precipitated behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperlocomotion, prepulse inhibition deficits and rewarding effects. In addition, a single dose of               S               -ketamine, but not               R               -ketamine, caused a loss of parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells in the prelimbic region of the medial PFC and DG. These findings suggest that, unlike               S               -ketamine,               R               -ketamine can elicit a sustained antidepressant effect, mediated by increased BDNF–TrkB signaling and synaptogenesis in the PFC, DG and CA3.               R               -ketamine appears to be a potent, long-lasting and safe antidepressant, relative to               S               -ketamine, as               R               -ketamine appears to be free of psychotomimetic side effects and abuse liability.},

  abstract = {Lesion studies link the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to executive functions. However, the evidence from in vivo investigations in healthy people is mixed, and there are no quantitative estimates of the association strength. To examine the relationship between PFC volume and cortical thickness with executive cognition in healthy adults, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that assessed executive functions and PFC volume (31 samples,) and PFC thickness (10 samples) in vivo, N = 3272 participants. We found that larger PFC volume and greater PFC thickness were associated with better executive performance. Stronger associations between executive functions and PFC volume were linked to greater variance in the sample age but was unrelated to the mean age of a sample. Strength of association between cognitive and neuroanatomical indices depended on the executive task used in the study. PFC volume correlated stronger with Wisconsin Card Sorting Test than with digit backwards span, Trail Making Test and verbal fluency. Significant effect size was observed in lateral and medial but not orbital PFC. The results support the “bigger is better” hypothesis of brain-behavior relation in healthy adults and suggest different neural correlates across the neuropsychological tests used to assess executive functions.},

  abstract = {Background: The goal of the current meta-analysis was to review and examine in detail the features of cognitive performance in psychotic (MDDP) versus non-psychotic (MDD) major depressive disorder. Methods: An electronic literature search was performed to find studies comparing cognitive performance in MDDP versus MDD. A meta-analysis of broad cognitive domains (processing speed, reasoning/problem solving, verbal learning, visual learning, attention/working memory) and individual cognitive tasks was conducted on all included studies (n ¼ 12). Demographic and clinical features were investigated via meta-regression analysis as moderators of cognitive performance. Results: No difference in socio-demographic and clinical variables was detected between groups. In general, a poorer cognitive performance was detected in MDDP versus MDD subjects (ES¼ 0.38), with a greater effect size in drug-free patients (ES¼0.69). MDDP patients were more impaired in verbal learning (ES¼0.67), visual learning (ES¼0.62) and processing speed (ES¼ 0.71) tasks. A significantly poorer performance was also detected in MDDP patients for individual tasks as Trail Making Test A, WAIS-R digit span backward and WAIS-R digit symbol. Age resulted to have a negative effect on tasks involved in working memory performance. Conclusion: In line with previous meta-analyses, our findings seem to support an association between psychosis and cognitive deficits in the context of affective disorders. Psychosis during the course of MDD is associated with poorer cognitive performance in some specific cognitive domains, such as visual and verbal learning and executive functions.},

  abstract = {Objective: Ketamine has demonstrated a rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effect in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but the neurocognitive effects of ketamine are relatively unknown. This study aims to examine the neurocognitive effects of six ketamine infusions and the association of baseline neurocognitive function and the change in severity of depressive symptoms after the last infusions. Methods: Sixty-four patients with MDD completed six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) administered over a 12-day period (Monday–Wednesday–Friday), and were followed by a 2-week observational period. Four domains of neurocognitive function (including speed of processing, working memory, visual learning and verbal learning) were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) at 0, 13 and 26 days. Results: In linear mixed model, significant improvements were found in terms of speed of processing (F = 20.7, p {$<$} 0.001) and verbal learning (F = 11.1, p {$<$} 0.001). The Sobel test showed the improvement of speed of processing (Sobel test = 2.8, p {$<$} 0.001) and verbal learning (Sobel test = 3.6, p {$<$} 0.001) were significantly mediated by change in depressive symptoms. Other two neurocognitive domains showed no significant changes over time. Correlation analysis showed no significant association of change in depressive symptoms with neurocognitive function at baseline. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that six ketamine infusions were associated with the improvement of speed of processing and verbal learning, which were partly accounted for by improvement in the severity of depression symptoms over time.},

  abstract = {Background: Ketamine has proven to have rapid, robust antidepressant effects on treatment-resistant depression. However, whether repeated ketamine infusions would cause short-and long-term neurocognitive impairments was not clear. Our aims were to investigate the neurocognitive effects of six ketamine infusions and to examine the association between these infusions and the antidepressant response in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Methods: Six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over a 12-day period were administered to 84 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Severity of depressive symptoms and four domains of neurocognition, including speed of processing, working memory, visual learning and verbal learning, were assessed at baseline, one day following the last infusion and again two weeks post-infusion. Results: Significant improvements were found on speed of processing (F=9.344, p{$<$}0.001) and verbal learning (F=5.647, p=0.004) in a linear mixed model. The Sobel test showed significant indirect effects between time and improvement in speed of processing (Sobel test=3.573, p{$<$}0.001) as well as improvement in verbal learning (Sobel test=6.649, p{$<$}0.001), which were both significantly mediated by change in depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analysis showed ketamine responders had better visual learning at baseline than non-responders (B=0.118, p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that neurocognitive function would not deteriorate after six ketamine infusions, while verbal learning and speed of processing improved over 13 days and 26 days of observation, respectively. However, this change was mainly accounted for by improvements in severity of depressive symptoms over time. Greater baseline visual learning predicted an antidepressant response over six ketamine infusions.},
