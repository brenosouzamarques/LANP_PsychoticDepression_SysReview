  abstract = {Psychotic depression was initially considered to be at one end of a continuum of severity of major depression. Subsequent experience demonstrated that psychosis is an independent trait that may accompany mood disorders of varying severity. While much has been learned about the impact of severe mood congruent delusions and hallucinations on the course and treatment response of depression, less is known about fleeting or mild psychosis, mood incongruent features, or psychotic symptoms that reflect traumatic experiences. Acute treatment of psychotic unipolar depression generally involves the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic drug or electroconvulsive therapy. There is inadequate information about maintenance treatment of unipolar psychotic depression and acute and chronic treatment of psychotic bipolar disorder. Decision-making therefore still must rely in part on clinical experience.},

  abstract = {Neuropsychological functioning has been a focus of study in psychotic disorders for many decades. These studies have focused primarily on schizophrenia, and less so on the affective psychoses, including psychotic major depression PMD. Several studies have provided evidence of cognitive dysfunction in PMD. However, these studies have utilized different assessment methods and instruments. Consequently, a clear picture of the nature and severity of cognitive impairment in PMD has yet to emerge in the literature. The current review seeks to provide a summary of the literature by composing a quantitative and qualitative review of the research to date on the cognitive impairment in psychotic major depression, specifically as it contrasts to those deficits observed in nonpsychotic depression. This review also provides a summary model of the pathophysiology of PMD to provide the necessary context to understanding the biological mechanisms of these impairments.},

  abstract = {The subcortical dysfunction hypothesis of verbal learning and memory deficits in depression was evaluated by comparing the memory test profiles of unipolar depressives (n=40) and bipolar depressives (n=9) with those of patients with a prototypical subcortical dementia (Huntington’s disease, HD), patients with a prototypical cortical dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, AD), and normal controls. In a discriminant function analysis that well-differentiated the HD, AD, and normal subjects, it was found that 28.6\% of the depressed patients were classified as HD patients (DEP-HD subjects), 49.0\% were classified as normals (DEP-N subjects), none were classified as AD patients, and 22.4\% were not well-classified. The DEPHD group closely resembled the HD group on additional indices of verbal learning and memory, and differed from the DEP-N group, which strongly resembled the normal control group. DEP-N patients also performed significantly better than DEP-HD patients on a number of other neuropsychological tests (e.g., WAIS-R Digit Symbol, category fluency, Trail Making Test Part B). The findings provide support for the subcortical dysfunction hypothesis, but only for a subgroup of depressed patients. Implications for differentiating depressive “pseudodementia” from AD are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Psychotic depression (PD) is classified as a subtype of severe depression in the current diagnostic manuals. Accordingly, it is a common conception among psychiatrists that psychotic features in depression arise as a consequence of depressive severity. The aim of this study was to determine whether the severity of depressive and psychotic symptoms correlate in accordance with this “severity–psychosis” hypothesis and to detect potential differences in the clinical features of PD and non-psychotic depression (non-PD). Methods: Quantitative analysis of Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) scores from all patients admitted to a Danish general psychiatric hospital due to a severe depressive episode in the period between 2000 and 2010 was performed. Results: A total of 357 patients with severe depression, of which 125 (35\%) were of the psychotic subtype, formed the study sample. Mean HoNOS scores at admission differed significantly between patients with non-PD and PD on the items hallucinations and delusions (nonPD = 0.33 vs. PD = 1.37, p b 0.001), aggression (non-PD = 0.20 vs. PD = 0.36, p = 0.044) and on the total score (non-PD = 10.55 vs. PD = 11.87, p = 0.024). The HoNOS scores on the two items “depression” and “hallucinations and delusions” were very weakly correlated. Limitations: Diagnoses were based on normal clinical practice and not formalized research criteria. Conclusions: The symptomatology of PD and non-PD differs beyond the mere psychosis. Furthermore, severity ratings of depressive and psychotic symptoms are very weakly correlated. These findings offer further support to the hypothesis stating that the psychotic- and nonpsychotic subtypes of depression may in fact be distinct clinical syndromes.},

  abstract = {Background: The Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS) has been validated as a method of assessing the severity and treatment outcomes of psychotic depression (PD). We aimed to compare the results of the PDAS in PD and non-psychotic depression (non-PD) patients and validate the PDAS as a diagnostic tool for PD. Methods: We included 53 patients with PD and 441 with non-PD who participated in the Clinical Research Center for Depression study in South Korea. In addition to the PDAS, psychometric tools including the HAMD17, HAMA, BPRS, CGI-S, SOFAS, SSI-Beck, WHOQOL-BREF, AUDIT, and FTND were used to assess, respectively, depression, anxiety, overall symptoms, global severity, social functioning, suicidal ideation, quality of life, alcohol use, and nicotine use. Results: After adjusting for age and total HAMD17 score, PD patients had higher scores for depressive mood, hallucinations, unusual thought content, suspiciousness, blunted affect, and emotional withdrawal on the PDAS and higher total scores on the SSI-Beck than non-PD patients. Binary logistic regression identified hallucinatory behavior and emotional withdrawal as predictors of PD. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that emotional withdrawal could be used to differentiate psychotic from non-psychotic depression. Limitations: The inter-rater reliability for psychometric assessments was not evaluated. Conclusions: In addition to assessing the severity and treatment outcomes of PD, PDAS can help in the diagnosis of PD.},

  abstract = {Background: The goal of the current meta-analysis was to review and examine in detail the features of cognitive performance in psychotic (MDDP) versus non-psychotic (MDD) major depressive disorder. Methods: An electronic literature search was performed to find studies comparing cognitive performance in MDDP versus MDD. A meta-analysis of broad cognitive domains (processing speed, reasoning/problem solving, verbal learning, visual learning, attention/working memory) and individual cognitive tasks was conducted on all included studies (n ¼ 12). Demographic and clinical features were investigated via meta-regression analysis as moderators of cognitive performance. Results: No difference in socio-demographic and clinical variables was detected between groups. In general, a poorer cognitive performance was detected in MDDP versus MDD subjects (ES¼ 0.38), with a greater effect size in drug-free patients (ES¼0.69). MDDP patients were more impaired in verbal learning (ES¼0.67), visual learning (ES¼0.62) and processing speed (ES¼ 0.71) tasks. A significantly poorer performance was also detected in MDDP patients for individual tasks as Trail Making Test A, WAIS-R digit span backward and WAIS-R digit symbol. Age resulted to have a negative effect on tasks involved in working memory performance. Conclusion: In line with previous meta-analyses, our findings seem to support an association between psychosis and cognitive deficits in the context of affective disorders. Psychosis during the course of MDD is associated with poorer cognitive performance in some specific cognitive domains, such as visual and verbal learning and executive functions.},
